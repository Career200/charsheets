## tl;dr
 Cyberpunk 2020 character sheet app, potentially a Farflung character sheet app too

 ### I start a lot of things and time will come when they all merge into one finished, convenient, and useful app. This is where it all starts.

### As...

...an aspiring GM, Dungeon-master, Hakunin (twas a Fallout online RPG), Referee and a Master of Ceremonies, I longed to have more support for somewhat obscure role-playing systems, such as Cyberpunk 2020 (the OG as they say) and Farflung (that's a weird one, right) for years. This is why I ultimately decided that what exists for extremely popular systems, such as D&D and very specifically Pathfinder 2e ([pathbuilder, I'm referring to you](https://pathbuilder2e.com/app.html)), should also exist for the cybered-up gonks and cosmic fluffs of the world (i.e. my players).

### So...

I started small - came up with a Cyberpunk 2020 one-shot, found willing players (and first-timers at that!) and started a simple character sheet app. Well, it was a thing... Good enough to get rid of printed papers and good enough to show and say "look, this is what your character is, can, and has". And to myself - it's a way to store NPCs in a convenient way. And I thought, humbly, "I want it to be good".

And we played. And the game was fun. And I learned a lot. First and foremost, I learned that I need to learn a lot more (and players never said it, but I'm sure they thought so too).

### Now...

I've learned. I've found a real job as a developer. I've learned some more, I thought some more, and now I have a Farflung game in mind - and I have a group of players, well, ready to roll with it. And clearly I HAVE to make a tool for Farflung, I want to build stuff and use it - what's the point of web-dev otherwise?

Ok, not to spoil anything, but we'll be playing basically a knock-off Futurama. ***Good news, everyone!*** I'll be making a character sheet app for FARFLUNG. ***I'm sciencing as fast as I can***
