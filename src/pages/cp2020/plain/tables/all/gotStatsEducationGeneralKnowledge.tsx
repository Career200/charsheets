							This skill is the equivalent of a basic public school education,
							allowing you to know how to read, write, use basic math, and know
							enough history to get by. In effect, it is a "lore" or trivaia
							skill. A level of +1 is a basic grade school education. A skill of
							+2 is equal to a high school equivalency. A <em>Knowledge</em>{' '}
							Skill of +3 is equal to a college education, +4 or higher is equal
							to a Masters or Doctorate. At +7, you are an extremely
							well-educated person, and are asked to play Trival Pursuit a lot.
							At +9 and above, you are one of those people who knows a lot about
							everything (and hopefully has the good sense to keep his mouth
							shut).
