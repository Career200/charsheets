							There are two types of starting Skills:
							<strong>Career Skill Packages</strong> and
							<strong>Pickup Skills</strong>:
						</p>
						<p>
							The Career Skill Package is a group of skills that are known by
							your character as part of his or her Career. They're basics -
							Rockers know how to play instruments, Solos know how to shoot
							guns, etc.
							<strong>
								A starting character receive 40 points to distribute among his
								Career Skills. He may not use these points on his Pickup Skills,
								although he can choose to use future Improvement Points to
								Improve a Career Skill at any{' '}
							</strong>
							<strong>
								<u>later</u>
							</strong>
							<strong>
								time. He does not have to put points into all of his Career
								Skills (but it's a good idea - you never know).
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Important:</strong> It is required that one of your
							character's Career Skills be the Special Ability for his or her
							class. These Skills are unique to the class and reflect abilities
							and resources only that particular class possesses. Example are
							the Authority of Cops which allows them to use the weight and
							powers of Law or the Charismatic Leadership which allows a
							Rockerboy to convince a crowd to get down and party - or get out
							and riot. The number of points you put into your Special Ability
							(up to, but not greater than 10) reflects your position in your
							chosen field and the development of your unique career skill.
							Because of this, your Special Ability also determines you have to
							start with.
						</p>
						<p>
							Obviously while spreading those Career Points around it's going to
							be pretty tempting tot make yourself a wealthy Superstar, but
							remember a Rocker with lots of Charismatic Leadership and no
							performance skills will find that things can get ugly fast. They
							may love you but they paid 60 eb for those tickets so you'd better
							be smokin'.
