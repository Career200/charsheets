							This is equivalent of a "trained observer" skill, allowing
							characters to notice or be aware of clues, shadowers and other
							events. With an
							<em>Awareness</em> of +2 you will usually spot small pieces of
							paper with noted on them, doors left ajar , and obvious
							expressions of lying or dislike. An <em>Awareness</em> of +5 or
							better allows you to spot fairly well hidden clues, and fairly
							sophisticated attempts to "shadow" you. With an <em>Awareness</em>{' '}
							of +8 or greater, you routinely perform the sorts of deductive
							reasoning seen in the average TV cop show ("The murder was left
							handed because this knife has a specialized handle"). Sherlock
							Holmes has a +10 <em>Awareness</em>. Players without skill may
							only use their Intelligence Stat.
