							There are a wide variety of cybernetic devices available to the
							man on the move in the 2000's. But the basis for all these
							newtechs is chipware (also known as wetware by some), bio-plastic
							circuitry that allows the human body to mesh with the power of
							silicon microprocessors.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are two types of chipware; reflex (APTR) chips and
							memoryware (MRAM) chips. Each piece of chipware operates exactly
							like the skill of the same name. To use chips requires two
							separate installations: a neural processor located at the base of
							the spine, which translates the chip data into useful information,
							and a set of interface plugs or chipware sockets.
						</p>
						<p>
							The chip itself is a small, transparent sliver about an inch long,
							often color-coded for identification. It is inserted into the
							interface plug point down. It takes one turn to change chips. You
							may "run" as many separate chip programs at one time as your
							current INT stat.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>
								Example: My INT is 7. This means I can have up to seven
								different program chips operating at one time. I could be
								chipped for Karate, AV-4 Piloting, Pistol, Assault Weapons, AV-4
								repair, Play Instrument and Specific Knowledge: Rock Songs of
								the 1960s. However, I could not use any other chips until I'd
								removed one of these seven.
							</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Having chipware is like having instant skills whenever you want
							them. The problem is, chipware is expensive, and limited to only
							the lowest levels of a specific skill (from +1 to +3). To progress
							further, you would have to have a specially designed chip built at
							a higher level (not an easy proposition). A natural skill, on the
							other hand, progresses by use and this increase in ability costs
							nothing except time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Another problem with chips is that unlike natural skills, you
							can't learn to become better. If you're chipped for a{' '}
							<em>Karate</em> of +2, you'll be at that level of skill until you
							die, no matter how many fights you get into. You also can't
							combine natural and chipwared skills; for example, combining a
							chipped <em>Karate</em> of +2 and a natural Karate skill of +5 for
							a total of +7. The programmed responses of a chip will always
							override natural responses, setting the user's level of skill
							equal to that of the chip.
						</p>
						<p>
							Chips are best used when you need to know a lot of things all at
							once, but not very well. With chips, you can become a limited
							martial artist, pilot, driver, marksman. You can know a little bit
							more than you did before about a variety of subjects, but nowhere
							near as much as you would if you'd hit the books and studied.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Reflex (APTR) Chips:</strong> These are chips for
							Reflex-based skills only, such as weapon firing or hand-to-hand
							combat knowledge. These Augmented Programm TRCs feedloop - record
							a specific neural signal from one source, record it in memory,
							then use the recording to activate a series of muscle reactions in
							another source. Theoretically, these chips should allow even the
							lowliest "grunt" to have the skills of a karate master, the
							shooting ability of Wyatt Earp, and the reflexes of an Olympic
							athlete. But the limits of programming restrict what you can learn
							from a chip to a relatively low level (about +1 to +3).
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, a Reflex chip must adapt to your specific neural and
							muscular patterns, adjusting its instructions to fit your body and
							vice versa (after all, the karate master who was the pattern for
							the chip might have been five foot ten and you might be six foot
							three). It learns your body movements by sampling your responses
							as you practice using the chip. This process is known as chipping
							in and is required before the chip can be fully functional.
						</p>
						<p>
							Chipping in takes two full days of practice for every level of,
							the chip. This means, for example, if you've been chipped for
							<em>Martial Arts</em> +3, it will take six days of practice before
							the chip has "learned" enough about your body to be fully
							functional. If you only get two days of practice, the chip will
							function as a level +1 - practice for four days, and it's raised
							to +2.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Memory (MRAM) Chips:</strong> These are chips for
							information only, used for storage of raw data on a specific
							subject. A memory chip operates just like a skill of the same
							type, is rated from +1 to +3, and is applied to the same stat as
							the original skill (for example, AV-4 <em>Tech</em> would be
							combined with your TECH stat, while a <em>Language</em> chip would
							relate to your INT stat). MRAM chips do not require a previous
							knowledge of the skill involved and have no chipping-in time.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Chipware Socket:</strong> A small socket used only for
							inserting chipware (see above). With a chipware socket, you can
							use your interface plugs to control other things (such as weapons
							or vehicles), white still having access to MRAM and APTR
							information. Holds 10 chips.
