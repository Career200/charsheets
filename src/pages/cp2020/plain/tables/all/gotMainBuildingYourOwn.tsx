							Although drugs are bad news, they <em>are</em> a prominent theme
							of the cyberpunk genre. It stands to reason that sooner or later,
							enterprising Referees (or players) may want to unleash their own
							biochemical horrors on the world. As any fan of
							<em>Miami Vice</em> (or a player who watches a lot of real life
							cop shows) can tell you, drugs are a great way to get people fired
							up on the streets with lots of automatic weapons; in short, the
							perfect "McGuffin" for a mean, nasty, lowlife adventure.
						</p>
						<p>
							The drugs given here are only examples; it's a good idea for
							Referees to build any new ones before introducing them into
							gameplay. Drug building requires a
							<a href="028t016.htm">
								<em>Phormoceuticals</em>
							</a>{' '}
							Skill check against the DIFFICULTY of building the drug. To
							determine this value, you must first check the Effects Table below
							and choose what effects you want the drug to have. Add the total
							DIFFICULTY values together to arrive at a Base Difficulty for that
							drug.

						<p>
							<strong>Strength</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Strength is the power level of the drug. The higher the Strength
							of the drug, the greater it's plus or minus effect on the body.
							Drugs come in strengths from 1 to 3. Add the Strength of the Drug
							to its Base Difficulty.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Side Effects</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							You can buy down the cost of a drug by buying side effects. These
							are bad things that balance out the beneficial side of the drug
							(for example, if cocaine wasn't psychologically addictive and
							didn't cause delusions, it would be everything Sigmund Freud
							thought it would be). You may never buy a drug's Difficulty costs
							below 2.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Psychological Addiction (-8pts):</strong> The character is
							psychologically addicted, and must roll lower than his CL each
							hour following the last dose of the drug. On a failed roll, he
							suffers extreme anxiety, fear and depression; he become driven to
							find more of the drug and can do nothing else. Kicking the
							addiction is a VERY DIFFICULT Endurance check, and may take as
							long as the Referee decides is sufficient.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Physiological Addiction (-10pts):</strong> The character
							is physiologically addicted, and must roll lower than his BT each
							hour following the last dose of the drug. On a failed roll, he
							will suffer intense pain and take 2D6 in damage until he can kick
							the habit (a VERY DIFFICULT Endurance check, taking as long as the
							Referee decides is sufficient).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Death (-15pts):</strong> The drug has a fatal component
							that can kill the unawary. Each time the drug is taken, a Death
							Save must be made with a negative modifier equal to the drug's
							Strength number minus one.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Reduced REF (-5pts):</strong> The drug reduces REF at a
							rate of 1 point per dose for the duration of the dose. If a new
							dose is taken before the last has worn off, the REF penalty is
							cumulative.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Reduced INT (-5pts):</strong> The drug reduces INT at a
							rate of 1 point per dose for the duration of the dose. If a new
							dose is taken before the last has worn off, the INT penalty is
							cumulative.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Tremors (-2pts):</strong> The drug causes painful tremors
							in the hands, face (-2 to REF).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Hallucinations (-5pts):</strong> The drug causes
							hallucinations (colors, voices, strange shapes). The character is
							virtually unable to function normally If you buy this as a side
							effect for a hallucinogen, the character will always have a really
							bad trip that is totally at the Referee's sadistic discretion. You
							Have Been Warned.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Paranoia (-3pts):</strong> The character is subject to
							paranoic delusions; he thinks "they" are after him, etc. (although
							in
							<em>Cyberpunk</em>, this may not all be delusion). The character
							must drop everything and devote his actions to defending himself
							against "them". Who "they" are is, of course, up to the Referee.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Delusions (-5pts):</strong> The character is subject to
							strong delusions; he thinks untrue things are real, that aliens
							are talking to him, etc. The character must drop everything and
							devote all actions towards the maintenance of his delusion. Which,
							again, is up to the Referee.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Sterility (-8pts):</strong> The drug causes permanent
							sterility on a 3 in 10 chance.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Carcinogenic (-10pts):</strong> The drug causes cancer (3
							in 10). If cancer is developed, the character will take 1 point of
							permanent damage unless a cure is effective (a VERY DIFFICULT
							Medical Tech check) or he dies.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Psychotic Rage (-10pts):</strong> The drug causes the
							character to fly into a psychotic rage, attacking anyone within
							range.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Aggressive Behavior (-12pts):</strong> The drug causes the
							character to become irritable and aggressive. On a 5 in 10 chance,
							he will pick a fight with the nearest person to him.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Irrational Fear (-12pts):</strong> The drug causes the
							character to become inordinately fearful of everything. He must
							drop everything and cower in near catatonia until the drug wears
							off.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Nerve Degeneration (-15pts):</strong> The drug causes
							severe nerve damage (-2 REF lost permanently).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Duration</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Drug duration's vary from dose to dose, situation to situation.
							When a drug is taken, roll 1D6+1 to determine the total amount of
							time the drug will remain active in the system:
						</p>
						<div>
							<center>
								<table border={0} cellPadding="0" cellSpacing="0" width="70%">
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td width="50%">1D10+1 turns</td>
											<td width="50%">x1</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td width="50%">1D10+1 minutes</td>
											<td width="50%">x2</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td width="50%">1D10+1 hours</td>
											<td width="50%">x3</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</center>
						</div>
						<p>
							Multiply the total DIFFICULTY (BASE + STRENGTH, minus SIDE
							EFFECTS) to determine the final Difficulty of creating the drug.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Cost</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Per-dose cost is determined by multiplying the Difficulty level of
							the drug by 25 euro.
							<em>
								Example: Sindementaphilinine has a Difficulty of 26. Its street
								cost would be 650eb per dose.
							</em>
