							Flamethrowers are much like other area effect weapons, with one
							difference; they can be "swept" between two points. When using
							flamethrowing weapons, you may decide both a starting point and an
							ending point; then roll to Hit, determining if you're on target.
							Missed rolls refer to the
							<a className="text-orange-400" href="#">
								<em>Grenade scatter chart</em>
							</a>
							. Anything caught in the sweep between the two points is ignited.
							Using these weapons in anything other than the cyberweapon form
							requires the{' '}
							<a href="028r009.htm">
								<em>Heavy Weapons</em>
							</a>{' '}
							Skill; cyberweapon flamers use
							<a href="028r008.htm">
								<em>Handgun</em>
							</a>{' '}
							Skill as the default. Damage is 2D1O the 1st turn, 1D1O and 1D6
							the following two turns. Hard armors protect normally. Soft armors
							must be &gt;15SP to protect the target, and are damaged 2pts/hit.
