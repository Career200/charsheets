							Just in case it didn't work out, you can still make a dead comrade
							pull his weight. The Lifeline Act of 1994 (an extension of the
							donor cards of the 1980s) allows a potential source of spare parts
							to carry a donor card in his wallet. This card must be registered
							with the federal government. Only donor carded bodies can be
							turned into a donor center, where a bounty is paid. The bounty is
							based on the parts involved and the body condition at the time.

							The Government doesn't care who turns (he body in. All you need is
							the card and a legitimate death certificate stating that the
							deceased died of natural or accidental causes, available through
							any local coroner. The result is that many firefights end with a
							frenzied looting of bodies for donor cards - followed by another
							firefight over disputed claims and ending in another frenzy of
							looting.
						</p>
						<p>
							Legally, donor centers must be located in legitimate offices of
							the County or City Coroner's Office, or in a public hospital.
							However, a thriving black market in fraudulent donors thrives in
							most of the combat zones, usually out of "ripperdoc" clinics or
							Corporate centers (where high level execs get first pick of the
							new parts).
						</p>
						<p>
							The biggest problem with Body Bank re-placements is the
							availability of genetically matching parts. When attempting to
							locate a replacement limb or other part at a body bank, roll 1D10.
							On a 1, 2, or 3, the part is unavailable that day. On a 4 or 5,
							the part is in, but it may be the wrong color or have some other
							minor difference.
