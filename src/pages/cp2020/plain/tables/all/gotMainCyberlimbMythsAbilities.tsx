						<p>
							The popular myth about cyberlimbs is that they enable their owners
							to perform all kinds of superheroic feats. To a point, it's true;
							cyberlimbs can be designed with boosted strength and speed, using
							synthetic muscle fibers and silicon chips. What you won't find are
							people running at 200 miles an hour, bending steel bars with their
							hands or throwing Volkswagens around. Why can't you go around
							lifting cars and punching down walls like the cyborgs in the
							comics? Simple physiology. The replacement limb must be able to
							work in concert with the remaining "meat" parts of the body. Even
							if your arm was ten times stronger than before, the back and
							shoulder muscles supporting that cyberlimb wouldn't be - and
							they'd shred long before the artificial muscles did. But within
							limits, a cyber-equipped person can do some pretty impressive
							party tricks:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Crushing:</strong> A cybernetic arm uses synthetic muscle
							fibers instead of flesh and blood. They don't get tired, and they
							don't feel pain. They are also much stronger than normal muscle
							tissue. This gives a cyberarm tremendous gripping power. All
							cyberlimbs can easily crush light metals, woods and plastics. They
							can crush glass and plastic to dust (although they can't crush
							lumps of coal into diamonds!). In combat, any crushing grip with a
							cyberarm will do 2D6 damage.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Pain:</strong> Cyberarms never grow tired, allowing the
							wearer to hang from high places indefinitely. You can turn off the
							touch sensors with the flick of a mental switch, eliminating pain
							and allowing you to perform feats such as reaching into raging
							fires, dabbling in tanks of liquid nitrogen, and picking up
							red-hot pokers. A gunshot wound to a cyberlimb has no pain
							effects; you don't have to make a saving roll against shock and
							stun.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Damage:</strong> Cyberlimbs can take (and dish out) a
							tremendous amount of damage, so much so that they are treated like
							machinery for the purposes of game combat. All cyberlimbs can take
							up to 20 points of structural damage before they are useless, and
							up to 30 total points of structural damage before they are
							destroyed. A cyberarm punch does 1D6 damage to its target; wall,
							car, someone's head; no matter. A cyberleg kick will do 2D6
							damage.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Leaping:</strong> Cyberlegs employ powerful pistons and
							microservos, backed by bundles of synthetic muscles. With a pair
							of them, you can leap tremendous distances. Characters with paired
							cyberlegs can leap 6 meters straight up, or make a running jump of
							up to 8 meters.

							These are things which can be done to a basic cyberlimb to improve
							its strength, damage capacity, or flexibility. In addition to
							these improvements, artificial shoulders can be mounted at waist
							level to provide extra arms. A cyberlimb on hold up to 4 options
							or built-ins. A hand or foot is considered to be one option.
							(Cyberlimbs automatically come with basic foot modules).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Quick-change mounts:</strong> These allow the user to
							change cyberlimbs without using tools. The limb is bayonet
							mounted, and can be removed by depressing a thumb catch and
							twisting to the left. Quick-change mounts may also be used at the
							wrist or ankle. Joints to allow a variety of hands or feet to be
							used. To calculate HL, average the HC's of all the options you're
							using with the mount, then double it.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Hydraulic rams:</strong> Common to Soviet cyberwear, rams
							are bulkier and heavier than myomar fibers (the limb will not pass
							inspection as real no matter how well covered by Realskinn), but
							can take more damage (30 SOP to disable, 40 to destroy). Limb
							strength is also increased (3x crush, punch, and kicking damage).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Thickened myomar strands:</strong> These give limbs
							greater strength (2x normal damages) and durability (+5 SDP).
							Leaps are increased by 50%.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Reinforced joints:</strong> These are made of titanium
							steel instead of stainless and add +5 SDP to the cyberlimb.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Artificial shoulders:</strong> These are swivel joints
							which can be mounted to a back mounted frame. This allows up to
							two extra arms to be mounted at waist level. The unit has an SDP
							of 25.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Microwave &amp; EMP shielding:</strong> Protects your
							cyberlimb from electromagnetic pulse and microwave attacks.
							Shielding may be placed on any type of limb no matter what
							covering is used; it is placed internally, using up one space in
							the limb.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Coverings:</strong> White all cyberlimbs come in a
							stripped or uncovered state, they can be covered in a variety of
							ways. The cheapest method is a plastic covering, available in a
							variety of colors with airbrushing or transparent with imbedded
							tights and holography. A plastic covering may also be chromed (a
							popular option) or covered with a metallic skin tinted in golds
							blues greens reds or silvers. The most expensive option is
							Realskinn, a flexible plastic that looks very much like skin with
							follicles hairs, small scars and imperfections, it has a 75%
							chance of passing as a "meat" limb to all but the closest
							inspection.
						</p>
						<p>
							In lieu of a covering, the cyberlimb can be armored with Kevlar
							and ballistic plastic. This armor covering protects the limb with
							an SP of 20 However, you may not cover or chrome an armored limb.
