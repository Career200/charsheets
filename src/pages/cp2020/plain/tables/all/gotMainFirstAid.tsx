							<em>First Aid</em> involves cleaning and dressing the wounds,
							administering medication, setting broken limbs and putting on
							splints. When a character makes a successful First Aid skill
							check, the patient will recover at the rate of 0.5 points per day.
							<em>
								Example: A Light wound would be healed in 8 days. A Critical
								wound would heal in 24 days, a Mortal 3 wound in 56 days.
							</em>
							Only one check need be made. You may (within reason and at
							Referee's discretion), perform first aid on yourself. On an
							unsuccessful roll, the patient regains no points. New attempts may
							be made once per day until a successful roll is made.
