							The Net is basically a vast "potential space" constructed by
							linking together phone lines and fiberoptic control cables. The
							<strong>Ihara-Grubb Transformation</strong> algorithms that govern
							Net reality generate this space as a "wire-skeleton" topography of
							grids and shapes. Areas of high line resistance (old lines,
							garbled transmissions), appear as "mountains", while areas of low
							line resistance appear as plains and valleys, individual computer
							systems appear as ICONS or constructs created from millions of
							tiny "bits" of color and light, which, like video images or
							halftone photographs, can only be distinguished as individual
							parts by close examination. To simplify navigation through
							Netspace, the actual communications lines of the Net are
							represented as an endless blue-white grid. When an individual line
							must be located, programs within the Netrunner's cyberdeck locate
							the required lines or access points, and identify them with a
							bright red beacon light.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Ihara-Grubb Transformations are also designed to take the
							relative position of a system into account in relation to it's
							contiguous Netspace. For example, a computer system high in a
							skyscraper will appear as an icon far up in Netspace. A system
							buried underground will be positioned roughly as in relation to
							the plane of Netspace as it is relative to the ground level in
							external reality (or Realspace). Both systems can be found in a
							Netspace location analogous to their real locations in their
							individual subgrids. A moving system will travel through the
							subgrids that are parallel to its travel in Realspace.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any place a computer can be turned on and hooked into the NET is
							an extension of the NET into this universe. The Net is, as far as
							anyone can tell, potentially infinite - if you can link a computer
							to this communications web, you will automatically create a new
							section of the Net around that computer. Thus, new areas are
							created all the time, as more computers are hooked up and logged
							onto The Net.
						</p>
						<p>
							Theoretically, you could put a radio/Net link into a long range
							spaceprobe and extend the Net into deep space. But it would take a
							looooong time to get to that area of Netspace, and it would take
							forever to do things, Ihara and Grubb theorized that an alien
							intelligence with a lot of power and a knowledge of Earth
							computer-tech could link to the Net over interstellar distances.
							Probably, it could not actually do anything; the best solution
							would be to beam a link to an orbital satellite, downloading a
							copy of the alien Al into the Net at this end, then move freely
							about the Net.
