							The knowledge of the "seamy" ways of life - where to get illegal
							and contraband things, how to talk to the criminal environment,
							and avoiding bad situations in bad neighborhoods. With
							<em>Streetwise</em> of +3 or better, you can get "hot" items,
							torture drugs, etc. A <em>Streetwise</em> of +5 would know you to
							arrange a murder contract, you know a few mobsters who might owe
							you, and be able to call on muscle when you need it. At +8 or
							better, you could become a major crimelord yourself and the
							middlemen.
