							Cyberpsychosis is a big problem in the 2000's. While
							state-sponsored therapy is an option, the hardest part is getting
							the patient into the psychologist's office. What do you do when a
							metal armored, cyberboosted maniac starts randomly killing people?
							If you're the Government, you organize a special squad of
							professional police with one job - to hunt down and capture or
							kill murderous cyberpsychos.

							Cybersquads are common to most urban police departments, going
							under names like C-SWAT (Cybernetic Special Weapons &amp; Tactical
							Squad), PSYCHE-DIV, CYB-Enforcement and MAX-TAC (Maximum Force
							Tactical Division). They are armed with the best in armor, commo
							equipment and vehicles. Most carry weapons that start at the light
							cannon range and up. They are, by nature, not very nice people.
