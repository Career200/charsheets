						<p>
							One of the most powerful Corporations of the Cyber Age is the
							Trauma Team, a bonded and licensed paramedical franchise operating
							throughout the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe. These crack
							ambulance units are specifically designed to get to the scene of a
							fatality within seven minutes (or your money back).
						</p>
						<p>
							Trauma Team's crews are made up of the best paramedical techs and
							staff available. The teams are usually made up of a driver, a
							senior Medtechie, an assistant and two security officers. They
							normally travel in a heavily armored AV-4 aircraft, supported by
							mobile tanker trucks and ground refueling stations. A Trauma Team
							AV-4 contains the most sophisticated revivification and life
							support technology available, including a mobile cryotank to lower
							the body temperature to approximately 24 degrees F, (the optimum
							temperature to prevent hemorrhaging, shock, and brain swelling).
						</p>
						<p>
							Trauma Teams can be summoned by dialing 911 on any phone, and are
							equipped to trace the origin of any phone call to its source.
							(You're billed from the moment you call, until delivery to the
							Hospital.) You may also opt to carry a deadman transmitter, which
							will activate and automatically signal a Trauma Team the moment
							your brainwave pattern falls into a coma state. The most common
							transmitter is in the form of a plastic credit card, which is
							activated by bending the card in half, and has a range of 20
							miles. Trauma cards can be transferred between members of a group
							as long as the card's owner is present to sign the charges off
							when the Team arrives.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are usually a dozen or more Trauma Teams on call at any time
							in a major city. Immediately after receiving an alert, the nearest
							Trauma Team unit goes airbome, their sophisticated tracking
							equipment homing in on the last known location of the patient. The
							pilot (who is skilled enough to set his six-ton AV-4 on top of a
							parked car if need be), drops in as close as possible. If the
							firefight is still going on, the security team secures the area
							(using the AV's twin autocannon or their own portable weapons).
							The medtechs load the patient on board, shunting his life support
							Co the onboard heart-lung machines, plugging him into onboard
							biomonitors, and chilling his body down in the refrigerated tank
							for stabilization. Rapid surgery is performed on the spot for the
							most critical wounds, while the med specialist uses a combination
							of electroshock, drugs and manual resuscitation to get the patient
							on-line again. The pilot slams down the throttles and the AV-4
							rockets skywards on a pillar of exhaust, headed for the nearest
							emergency room. The entire process may have taken all of four
							minutes from start to finish.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a privately owned concern. Trauma Teams are not under any
							obligation to transport a casualty to a hospital, although they
							are responsible for reviving and stabilizing critically wounded
							patients. Trauma Team fees are exceedingly steep ($ 100 per
							minute), the best method of offsetting their exorbitant costs is
							to either carry Trauma Team services as part of a Corporate group
							insurance policy, or to establish an account with TT
							International, paying a premium of $500 in advance each month for
							continued service.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Spare Parts</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							These are places where you can get the raw materials for putting
							people back together again. They are a staple of the Cyberpunk
							landscape, and a good source of steady income for the enterprising
							street dweller.
