							In the old days, they would have called you a yuppie - a hard
							driven, fast-track MBA on his way up the Corporate ladder. Sure,
							it's selling your soul to the Company, but face it; the
							Corporations rule the cyberpunk world. They control governments,
							markets, nations, armies - you name it. And you know that whoever
							controls the Corporations controls everything else.
						</p>
						<p>
							Right bow, your life as a junior executive is anything but easy.
							There are guys underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job.
							There are guys over you who'd kill to keep out of their jobs. And
							they're not kidding about the killing - every up and comer in the
							Corporation has his own crew of Solos and Netrunners to cover his
							pet projects. Sabotage? Constantly. Bribery? Routine. Blackmail?
							Common. Promotion by assassination? Always a possibility. The
							stakes are that high - one slip and you could be out on the Street
							with the rest of the trash. Or dead.
						</p>
						<p>
							And the projects your supervisors give you! Some are pretty
							straightforward; design a new productivity schedule for the
							Corporation's medical subsidiary. Some are pretty raw - send a
							"black operations" team into the City to spread a designer plague
							so the Marketing team can clean up selling the vaccine. Last week,
							you led a mixed team of Solos, 'Runners and Techies on a
							headhunting run to kidnap a researcher from a rival company. The
							week before, your project was to steal plans for a new suborbital
							shuttle from the EuroSpace Agency (so that the Aerospace Division
							could copy the design and sell it to the Soviets).
						</p>
						<p>
							You told yourself you joined the Corporation to make it better
							place - work from the inside, you said. But now you're not sure.
							Your ideals are a little tarnished and things are getting pretty
							bleak. But you can't worry about ethics now. You've got a report
							due in an hour, and it looks like that guy in Sales is planning to
							ice your database for good. You're gonna ice him first.
