						<p>
							<strong>Friday Night firefight</strong> (FNFF) is a weapons combat
							system for using modern, futuristic and archaic firearms in
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> adventures. It's designed to cover all major
							elements of weapons combat in an easy to use format, allowing
							realistic fire fight action without resorting to lots of tables
							and charts. FNFF also covers melee weapons, hand to hand combat
							and martial arts as well, all in a simple system that allows you
							to use strategy over firepower.
						</p>
						<p>
							There's a lot of vague ideas and theories about modem weapons
							encounters - most of them from the Hollywood
							Never-Empty-Six-Gun-School of Armed Combat. These misconceptions
							have crept on little flat feet into the design of many
							role-playing games, leading to characters who can be repeatedly
							shot with large caliber handguns until they run out of "hit
							points" and who can fire Ingram MAC-10's one-handed and hit with
							every bullet.
						</p>
						<p>In other words, good, clean fun.</p>
						<p>
							FNFF is not good, clean fun. Most of the data herein has been
							complied from ballistics reports, police data, FBI statistics and
							other not-clean fun sources. These sources tend to point to a
							couple of basic truths about firefight combat.
						</p>
						<p>
							80% of most gunfights occur between untrained amateurs at a range
							of 21 feet. 50% of these raging gun battles happen within 8 feet
							or less! Most (60%) occur in dimly lit and difficult conditions -
							dark, tiny alleys, with both participants panting and out of
							breath, pausing momentarily to snap off a badly aimed shot at a
							fleeing shadow, then ducking back for cover. Hits are surprisingly
							rare. When they do occur (assuming a large caliber weapon's
							involved), the victim is usually hors de combat on the first shot
							from a combination of round-shock and terror. A solid hit with a
							.44 magnum will usually splatter a real person all over New
							Jersey.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the other hand, this <em>Cyberpunk</em>, right? So why are we
							telling you do at this if we don't intend for you to go in there
							with guns blazing? If a large caliber handgun is truly something
							to be respected, who wants to lose character after character until
							they get the point?
						</p>
						<p>
							Here's where we get interfaced, gangboys. You've made this edition
							of FNFF simpler, better and more direct, so you can concentrate on
							how to fight; how to win every encounter (you'll only get to lose
							once). We're going to give you all the tips we've learned over
							hundreds of our own encounters, plus hot tips from cops, combat
							grunts, SWAT masters and other veterans who've done it on the line
							for real.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's true - a firefight is dangerous. But you can handle it.
							That's why you're <em>Cyberpunk</em>.
