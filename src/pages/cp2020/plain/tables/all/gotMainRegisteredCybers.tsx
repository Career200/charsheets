							Although the Uniform Criminal justice Code of the United States
							says you must actually commit a crime before you can be arrested,
							this doesn't stop most police departments from practicing
							selective crime prevention (especially those departments run by
							Corporations). The Psycho Squad keeps tabs on who buys what and
							where through informants, monitors and hidden tech detectors
							scattered all over the city. They usually have a good idea what
							gangs are loading up on megaware and who's most likely to cross
							the line into psychohood in the near future. When a potential perp
							looks like he's getting too close, the Squad picks him up off the
							Street and offers him a choice. He can go on like he is and risk
							having an "accident" happen some dark night ("...we're just
							worried that some public-spirited citizen might, you know, take it
							upon himself to, well... you know... adjust your attitude..."), or
							you can get <strong>registered</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Registration is sort of like parole; you agree to see a
							cyberpsychologist for monitoring and analysis (regaining 2 points
							of HC per week until your original EMP is restored), and the squad
							implants a small transmitter into your cyberwear, allowing them to
							know your general whereabouts. Just in case. The police don't
							hassle you and the Squad doesn't automatically gun you down with
							20mm cannon rounds if you boost a pack of <em>Smash</em> from the
							corner vend-mat.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's rumored that some departments also implant a small explosive
							charge and a radio detonator, but we all know that's against the
							Criminal Code, don't we?
						</p>
						<p>
							Besides, you don't <em>have</em> to register. But we thought you'd
							like to know. After all, there are those public-spirited citizens
							out there...
