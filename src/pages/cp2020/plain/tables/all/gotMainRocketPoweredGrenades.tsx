							Rocket Powered Grenades (RPGs) are a hybrid of grenade and rocket
							projectile, with far greater range and accuracy. They are also
							easier to acquire than missiles. With the exception of the
							disposable Armbrust RPG, most have the disadvantage of backblast,
							making them impossible to fire in a confined space. RPGS are fired
							as with other grenade launchers or shoulder arms, using the
