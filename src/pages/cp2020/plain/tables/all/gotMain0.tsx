							Something happens when you start adding metal and plastic to
							people. They start to change. And it isn't pretty.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the 2000's, we call this cyberpsychosis; a mental disease in
							which the addition of cybernetics causes an already unstable
							personality to fragment. At first, the victim begins to relate
							more to machines than to humans. Soon, he starts to ignore people
							- parents, friends, lovers. Eating, sleeping all become less
							important. Finally, human interactions begin to irritate,
							culminating in a terrifying rage that consumes the victim
							entirely.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>So, how do I get cyberpsychosis?</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Every character in Cyberpunk has an Empathy stat (EMP). This stat
							is a measure of how well the character relates to other people,
							and is the basis of such skills as leadership, lying, convincing
							and romantic relationships.
						</p>
						<p>
							Likewise, every major cybernetic enhancement has a corresponding
							<strong>Humanity Cost</strong>, which is added together to get an
							overall Humanity Cost of all enhancements. Humanity Costs are
							rated from VERY LOW to VERY HIGH, and correspond to the general
							effect this enhancement will have on the human psyche. In
							addition, each option added to an enhancement has an additional
							point value as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								For every ten points of Humanity Cost, the character loses one
								point of Empathy (unequal values are rounded down).
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>
								For example, say I add four new cybernetic devices for a total
								Humanity Cost of 36. I will lose 3 point: of Empathy.
							</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							This can start to cost you. With an Empathy of 3 the character is
							something of a "cold fish"; emotionless and cold. With an Empathy
							of 2, the character is chilly, forbidding, and distinctly
							unpleasant to others. With an Empathy of 1, the character is
							usually violent, sociopathic and vicious. He must constantly fight
							to keep from going over the edge and committing irrational,
							violent acts of murder and mayhem.
						</p>
						<p>
							At an Empathy rating of 0 or less, the character is fully in the
							grip of cyberpsychosis. He is driven by a maddening hatred of
							other humans or living things. At this point, there is no turning
							back-the character is taken over by the Referee, who plays it as a
							non-player character with all the worst attributes of a murderous,
							mechanized psychopath, called a cyberpsycho.
						</p>
						<p>
							Not all cyberpsychos are the rampaging type. Many exhibit more
							subtle symptoms; compulsive lying, kleptomania, sadism, brutality,
							split personality and extremely violent mood swings.
