							This skill allows the Rocker to sway crowds equal to his level
							squared time 200. This ability (added to your Cool stat) allows
							the Rockerboy to control, incite and charm large number of people
							through his or her performance skills. When under the Rocker's
							control, this group can easily be persuaded to act on his
							suggestion; for example, a Rocker could convince a concert crowd
							to riot in the streets or attack a heavily fortified police line.{' '}
							<em>Charismatic Leadership</em> will only work with groups of ten
							or more people as it is primarily a mob leadership ability. The
							higher your <em>Charismatic Leadership</em>, the larger a crowd
							you can control and the more direct and complex the instructions
							you can get them to follow. For example, a Level +3
							<em>Leadership</em> could incite a nightclub crowd to get rowdy. A
							Level +5 or +6 could provoke a concert crowd of thousands to trash
							a neighborhood, if the area wasn't too far from hall. At Level +9,
							and higher, you have the same sort of mesmeric ability as an
							Adolph Hitler - you can raise armies, start movements. And destroy
							nations.
