						<p>
							Cyberaudio systems patch into the auditory nerves and speech
							centers of the brain. This enhancement affects both ears, and also
							includes a subvocalizing mike on the mastoid bone. There is no
							visible change to the outer ear, although some cyberpunks replace
							the outer ear with a set of mechanical speaker pickups for max
							effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Radio Link:</strong> A microminiature radio transceiver,
							usually mounted at the base of the skull and using your fillings
							as the antennae. It is activated by clicking the teeth together
							sharply. To talk, you merely sub vocalize (mutter under your
							breath). Reception is carried out in one of two ways: 1) a
							receiver directly vibrates the mastoid bone, giving you a small
							tinny voice in the back of your head, or 2) linked to a
							cyberoptics Marquee option, incoming messages are flashed into the
							upper edge of your field of vision as red scrolling letters. In
							game terms, having a radio implant gives you the ability to talk
							to any receiver on the same band frequency for up to 1 mile. It
							also means you occasionally get someone else's radio messages.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Phone Splice:</strong> An improved radio splice, this
							implant is wired to communicate directly to your personal cellular
							phone. In practice, it allows you to do everything the radio
							splice does, but you must have your phone within 3 meters of you,
							and it must already be turned on and the number dialed. Audio
							spike is commonly used by busy Corporates who want to be able to
							answer calls, even in a meeting. One of the biggest advantages of
							audio splice is it's range - anywhere your phone will go, you can
							go. Even the Moon.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>ECM Scrambler:</strong> This implant improves your radio
							or audio spike with a scrambler, so it cannot be listened into. In
							game terms, this makes all radio or audiospike communications
							private, unless the interceptor has a descrambler unit and a lot
							of time on his hands.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Bug Detector:</strong> This mini-receiver is designed to
							pick up signals transmitted by all types of radio bugs. When the
							bug is active, its transmissions make a small beeping noise in the
							back of your head, getting louder as you get closer to the bug. In
							game terms, this gives you a 6 out of 10 chance (roll 1D10, choose
							your six numbers) of detecting any bugs within 10 feet of you. A
							normal option for Corporates, Fixers and Solos.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Wear-Man:</strong> A variant of the radio splice, the
							WearMan mounts twin vibration speakers on your mastoid bones,
							making your skull into a audio system of concert hall quality. A
							tiny chip mount wired into the earlobe allows you to plug in a
							variety of music chips, all fashioned to look like earnings. Or
							you can plug in direct to your interface plugs. Each chip contains
							about 100 songs. Selections are fast forwarded by squeezing the
							earring gently, once per selection. When the chip a removed, the
							WearMan turns off. A teeny bop fave.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Amplified Hearing:</strong> This system improves hearing
							and sound recognition ability, adding +1 to any sound-related
							Awareness check.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Voice Stress Analyser:</strong> This system acts as a lie
							detector, detecting minute changes in vocal patterns and tones and
							comparing these to a pre-recorded set of parameters. You must
							first use the analyser on the subject while he/she is in an
							unstressed situation or is telling the truth. All subsequent tests
							will give you a +2 to Human Perception or Interrogation skill
							checks on that particular subject.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Sound Editing:</strong> This system allows the user to
							edit out distracting noises or "zero in" on a particular sound.
							Activation of this system adds +2 to any sound-related Awareness
							check. Sound editing can be used in conjunction with Amplified
							Hearing or Enhanced Hearing.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Enhanced Hearing Range:</strong> This subsystem allows the
							user to hear tones in the subsonic and supersonic ranges.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Radar Detector:</strong> This system produces a loud beep
							whenever a radar beam is encountered. It also has a 40% chance of
							triangulating the source; when the direction of the beam is
							determined, the beep changes to a clear tone.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Homing Tracer:</strong> This option allows the character
							to follow a homing tone broadcast from an external sender. Range
							is 1 km. The tone increases in volume as the user gets closer to
							his target. The homing tracer comes with two senders, about the
							size and shape of a pin. Extra senders cost 25eb each.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Tight Beam Radio Link:</strong> This option allows tight
							beam radio communication for up to 1 mile, as long as both parties
							are within line of sight to each other and not blocked by any
							object thicker than 1 foot.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Wide Band Radio Scanner:</strong> This option
							automatically scans all major police, fire, ambulance, and Trauma
							Team communication bands. The user can set this scanner to cover
							one specific band, downloading any incoming messages to his own
							internal radio link or Times Square marquee.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Micro-recorder Link:</strong> Downloads anything heard by
							the user to either an internal or external (via interface plugs)
							sound recorder.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Digital Recording Link:</strong> This option allows
							anything heard by the user to be recorded on an internal microchip
							(2hrs). Recordings can be downloaded to an internal recorder or
							via interface plugs to an external recorder.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Level Damper:</strong> This system automatically
							compensates for loud noises, such as stun-bomb attacks or sonic
							weapons. Characters with this option can ignore all effects of
							these weapons.
