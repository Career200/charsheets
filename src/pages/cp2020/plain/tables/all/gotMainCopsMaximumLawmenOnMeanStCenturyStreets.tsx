							In the old days, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky
							if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled
							with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make an M-16 look
							like a kid's toy. If you're on a City Force, you know how bad it
							is. You're carrying at least four high caliber weapons, most of
							them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar vest that'll stop 850
							ft/lbs per square inch - and you're still outgunned and
							outflanked. Half the gangs are cyber to begin with - super speed,
							super reflexes, can see in the dark, carry weapons in their
							arms... The other half are freelance Corporate mercs - gangs hired
							by the Corps to enforce their policies on the Street. And there
							you are - a beat cop or detective in an armored squadcar,
							patrolling this jungle with the heavy predators.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Corporate Cops - now that's the life. Heavy weapons, full
							combat armor, Trauma Team tm backup, AV-4 assault vehicles and
							gyrocopters with miniguns. But they only patrol the sectors of the
							City that the Government's licensed them for. The nice, clean
							sectors full of new office buildings and fancy restaurants - where
							no jacked up psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing spree
							with an AK-47. You get the bad sections. Burned out buildings and
							abadoned cars, where every night is a new firefight and another
							great opportunity for a messy death.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're really unlucky, you might draw PsychoSqaud detail.
							PsychoSquad guys get the job of hunting down heavily armed and
							armored cyborgs who've flipped out. Sure the PS guys have access
							to railguns, gyros and AVs. But a cyberpsycho can walk through
							machine gun fire and not feel it. A lot of the PsychoSquad
							detectives are crazy themselves. They load up with boosted
							reflexes, get some monstrously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs
							solo. But you're not that crazy.
