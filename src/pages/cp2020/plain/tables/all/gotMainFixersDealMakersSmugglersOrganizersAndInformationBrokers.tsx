							You realized fast that you weren't ever going to get into a
							Corporate job. And you didn't think your were tough enough or
							crazy enough to be a Solo either. But as a small time punk, you
							knew you had a knack for figuring out what other people wanted,
							and how to get it for them. For price, of course.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now your deals have moved past the nickle-and-dime stuff into the
							big time. Maybe you move illegal weapons over the border. Or steal
							and resell medical supplies from the Corporations. Perhaps you're
							skill broker - acting as an agent for high priced Solos and
							'Runners, or ever hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's
							contacts. You buy and sell favors like an old-style Mafia
							godfather. You have connections into all kinds of businesses,
							deals and political groups. You don't do this directly, of course
							- no, you see your contacts and allies as a part of vast web of
							intrigue and coersion. If there's a hot nightclub in the City,
							you've bought into it. If there are new military-class weapons on
							the Street, you smuggled'em in. If there's a Corporate war going
							down, you're negotiating between sides with an eye on the main
							chance.
						</p>
						<p>
							But you're not entirely in it for the bucks. If someone needs to
							get the heat off, you'll hide them. You get people housing when
							there isn't any, and you bring in food when the neighborhoods are
							blockaded. Maybe you do it because you know they'll owe you later,
							but you're not sure. You're one part Robin Hood and two parts Al
							Capone. Back in the 90's, they would have called you{' '}
							<i>crimelord</i>. But this is the fragmented, nasty, deadly 2020s.
							Now they call you a Fixer.
