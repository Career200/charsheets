							At three, your parents bought you an old Apple IV GS with a Radius
							241 wall screen, and your life was changed. By fifth grade, you'd
							already mastered everything the school computer literacy lab could
							throw at you -you were already using C and META-LINGUA to crack
							into the district's mainframe and change your grades. When you
							were thirteen, you shifted enough funds out of unprotected
							TransAmerican Bank accounts to finance your first neural interface
							plugs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, nothing can stop you With your direct mental link to the
							computer, you can plunge headfirst into the dizzying data-winds of
							the Net; the worldwide telecommunications system that joins
							humanity together. As an electronic wraith, you are the ultimate
							"hacker", your brain wired into special modems and computer links.
							You slip into the "hardest" mainframe systems with ease. Your
							defense and offense programs are arrayed at a touch of your mental
							fingertips - a quick jolt of Demon or Vampire and the data
							fortresses fall. EBM. ITT. Sony-Matsushita-Ford. You've tackled
							them all, buying, trading and selling their deepest secrets at
							will.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sometimes you uncover important things - Corporate treachery or
							deadly secrets. But that's not why you Netrun. You live for the
							new program, the next satellite downlink - the next piece of hot
							data that comes your way. It's only a matter of time, you think -
							every year, the counter intrustion programs get better, the
							Artificial Intelligences smarter. Sooner or later, a faster
							program or programmer's going to catch up; reach out with
							electronic fingers through your interface plugs, and stop your
							heart. But time's on your side, and until the ride runs out,
							you'll be there, barebrained and headfirst in the Net.
