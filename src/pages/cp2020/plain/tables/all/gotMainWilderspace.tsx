							Movement between Long Distance Links is almost always done via
							up/downlinks. Most of the physical space is "jumped" over, and is
							pretty much unknown territory. Yet, the activation of individual
							computers can create independent areas not directly linked to the
							Net. The intervening distances between physical points of the Net
							(such as San Francisco and Night City) are called{' '}
							<em>Wilderspace</em>. Wilderspace was originally theorized in 2004
							by J.A. Grubb, a computer game designer and occasional hacker who
							conceived of it as a vast area of dormant, potential reality,
							which could come into existence when a computer was linked to the
							Net Without up/downlinks, this region would be isolated from the
							main traffic of the Net, and accessible only by those who were
							willing to "walk" there the hard way.

						<p>
							Netrunner legend is that "something" probably lives in
							Wilderspace: rogue Als, alien intellects, things which have their
							own separate "citygrids" that only appear occasionally when these
							forces open an up/downlink to the main Net. The equivalent would
							be a remote South Seas island which is unknown and unreachable,
							until a canoe is sent to the nearest civilization. If the natives
							were skilled at entering civilization and disguising their true
							nature, they could probably remain undiscovered for centuries.
