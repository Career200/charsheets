							This skill allows you to pilot all ground vehicles like cars,
							trucks, tanks and hovercraft. This skill is not usable for
							piloting aircraft. A skill +3 is equal to that of a very good
							non-professional driver. A skill of +6 allows you to drive with
							the skill of a moderately skilled race driver. An driver with
							skill of +8 or greater will be nationally ship races, and possibly
							have access to the most advanced ground vehicles available (as
							long as he makes an endorsement).
