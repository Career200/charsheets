							Missiles and Rockets include radar and optically guided missiles,
							mini-rockets and shoulder rocket launchers. Using missiles
							requires use of the <a href="028r009.htm">Heavy Weapons</a> Skill.
							When firing missiles and rockets, treat them as rifle-fired
							grenades with longer ranges and larger areas of effect. Damage
							varies.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Note for Rockets and Missiles:</strong> If a rocket or
							missile has an Armor-Piercing warhead, the armor's SP is halved,
							but the damage that penetrates is not.
