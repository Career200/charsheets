							One of the other benefits of the I-C Transformations are that they
							allow you to translate the signal of your cyberdeck into a visible
							representation in the Net. This representation of yourself is
							known as your ICON.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most things in the Net have some kind of ICON; even if one isn't
							specified, the I-C formulas will create a polygonal form to
							represent them. Your ICON is your personal symbol; it's what other
							Netrunners will talk to and relate with when they encounter you in
							Netspace. Your ICON can look like anything you want it to: armored
							technowarrior, fantasy creature, bizarre shape or logo - even
							yourself. You can change your ICON any time you enter the Net. You
							can even disguise your ICON by using special programs for stealth
							and evasion. Choosing your ICON is one of the first things you'll
							decide when you jack in. Make sure it's got your personal style
							written all over it.
