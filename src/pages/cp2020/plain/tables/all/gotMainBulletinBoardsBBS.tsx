							A BBS is a friendly Data Fortress where Runners can meet to
							exchange information, chat, swap software and so on. A BBS Data
							Fortress is usually heavily protected and hidden somewhere. A code
							word or very complex encryption is needed to get in. Once inside,
							the BBS user encounters a number of "areas" or "clubrooms"
							designated for various functions. These are usu-ally designed
							around thematic virtual realities. For example, the{' '}
							<em>Hunt Club</em> BBS of Denver is an elaborate virtual reality
							construct of a grand old English manor house, complete with
							servants, a drawing room and a croquet green.
