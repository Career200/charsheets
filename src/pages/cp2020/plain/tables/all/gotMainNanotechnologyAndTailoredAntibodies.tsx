							<strong>Nanotechnology</strong> involves the use of in-credibly
							tiny, psuedo-organic machines to perform minute surgical tasks.
							These tiny tools can be programmed to repair dam-aged cells with
							molecule-sized polymer threads, or to act as temporary bridges
							between mutilated nerve endings.
						</p>
						<p>
							Combined with tailored antibodies, nanotech devices can speed
							healing to twice the normal rate (patients recover 1 point per day
							in addition to normal healing). A Light Wound for example, would
							be healed in two days, while a Mortal Wound 0 would completely
							heal in eight days. When combined with speed healing drugs, this
							rate is increased to 3 points per day, allowing the same mortally
							wounded character to be back in action in an unbelievable six
							days!
						</p>
						<p>
							Here's the catch. Besides being expensive (1500 eb. per treatment)
							nanotech is available only in certain hospitals (1 in 10). But if
							you've got the money, it's the best option for getting back on the
							Street fast.
