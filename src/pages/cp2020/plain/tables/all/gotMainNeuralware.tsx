							One of the most important aspects of cybertech is invisible to the
							naked eye. This type of enhancement, known as neuralware, is
							usually in the form of tiny co-processing chips and nerve
							amplifiers that increase existing abilities.
						</p>
						<p>
							The basic neural processor is a "switch-box" implanted into the
							lower spine, and is used to route signals from external cyberwear
							to the central nervous system. It is the main system for any type
							of neural interface, including reflex boosters, interface plugs,
							weapon, DataTerm and vehicle links, mini-computers and sensory
							augmentations. The Neural processor has a small inspection space
							which allows secondary co-processors to be inserted into the basic
							processor module. This makes upgrading a process of opening the
							inspection space in a sterile environment and inserting the new
							co-processors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Implanting a neural processor is far easier than one would expect,
							thanks to the science of nanotech. The basic module is surgically
							affixed to the spine, where it releases a flood of nanosurgical
							units into the spinal column. These microscopic machines thread
							tiny linkages through the central nervous system, hooking nerve
							endings to the neural processor. This process takes some time
							(1D6+7 days) before the nanosurgeons have worked their way through
							the entire body and all the connections are hooked up to the
							neural processor.

							These are specialized "add-ons" which can be plugged into the main
							neural processor at any time; the whole process takes about an
							hour and can be performed in any walk-in clinic. Some, like reflex
							boosters, allow you to improve your reactions and perceptive
							abilities to inhuman levels; others, like link co-processors,
							allow you to interface with computers, databases, vehicles and
							other machines. Once you have the basic neural processor, you can
							jack in as many options as you like.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Reflex Boosters:</strong> These are specialized TRC
							co-processors that amplify and speed up signal processing. The
							biggest advantage to a REFLEX boost is its ability to increase a
							character's initiative rolls in combat. There are two types of
							Reflex co-processors (also known as <em>boosterware</em>). Note:
							this is the only type of boost which can be used with the
							<em>Boostmaster</em> enhancement in <em>Solo of Fortune</em>. You
							may only select one type of boosterware (and you may not combine
							multiples of a single type of boost).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Kerenzikov boosterware</strong> is always activated; the
							character is always reacting with a higher than normal reaction
							speed. Since Kerenzikov often boosts responses to greater than 10,
							it has a high humanity cost, as the user must learn to readjust
							his or her actions to a world that appears to be moving in slow
							motion. Because of this, Kerenzikov boost can be installed at two
							levels of augmentation (+1 or +2 to Initiative, HL is 1D6 or 2D6).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Speedware</strong> (also known as Sandevistan) kicks in
							only when desired, eliminating much of the need to adapt one's
							entire life to an inhumanly fast reaction time. The character must
							first subvocalize a mental command word before boost is activated,
							then wait one turn before the boost kicks in. He will remain
							boosted for five full turns (+3 to initiative rolls) before the
							boost cuts out. He must then subvocalize the command again, and
							wait 2 turns before regaining a boosted state.
						</p>
						<p>
							Speedware's big advantages are in lower humanity costs and
							improved performance; because the body isn't "on" all the time,
							more can be drawn from it during the boost mode.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Tactile Boost:</strong> This increases any Awareness roll
							involving touch by +2. The boost can be turned on or off at will,
							taking one turn to do so.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Pain Editor:</strong> This coprocessor overrides the pain
							receptors of the brain, making the subject impervious to torture,
							deprivation or physical hardship. It doesn't mean he isn't getting
							hurt, just that he won't notice it until he collapses (make
							Endurance Skill checks, but at two levels of difficulty lower than
							normal).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Olfactory Boost:</strong> This increases any Awareness
							roll involving smell by +2. In addition, the subject adds +2 to
							his Shadow/Track skills (he can track by smell), and has a 50%
							chance of locating a scent to begin tracking with unless the
							target has taken particular pains to disguise its scent). The
							boost can be turned on or off at will, taking one turn to do so.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Links:</strong> Links are specialized co-processors that
							allow you to translate signals from the device you want to run
							into your neural code. There are five major types of link; you
							must have the proper link in order to run that type of device.
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								<strong>Cybermodem Link:</strong> This is the basic processor
								that translates Net information into images. It replaces the
								more limited interface programs of the early 'teens, and allows
								the Netrunner to perceive a wider variety of environments than
								its predecessors.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Vehicle Link:</strong> This allows the user to control a
								vehicle through direct mental control. Cybervehicles include
								cars, AV-4s, aircraft, rotorcraft or motorcycles which have had
								their normal control systems replaced by a computer. The
								character plugs directly into the computer using interface plugs
								and cables, sending commands through his own nervous system.
								Power servos then steer wheels, depress accelerators, and
								control braking. Cybervehicles are inhumanly responsive - like
								driving an extension of yourself. As a result, a cyberassisted
								vehicle will automatically give you a +2 on any driving,
								piloting or motorcycle driving skill you are using at the time.
								To modify a normal vehicle to cybervehicle stats costs an
								additional 40% of the base vehicle cost.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Smartgun Link:</strong> Smartguns are modified versions
								of normal firearms, linked to an internal microcomputer, which
								in turn is jacked to a human operator. A smartgun uses a small
								sonic or laser projector to lock onto the target, scanning it
								thousands of times per second. As the gun traverses the desired
								target, the computer link picks up your mental fire signal (or
								incoming data from the targeting reticule of your cyberoptic)
								and triggers the gun. Smartguns are far more accurate than most
								other guns; using them automatically gives you a +2 to any
								firearms attack you are making. The cost of adapting a normal
								gun to smartgun configuration is twice the normal cost of the
								gun.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Machine/Tech Link:</strong> This allows the user to
								interface with (and control) any auto-factory or heavy machine
								operating from a MLINK-based control system. You can also
								control small machines/appliances in non-factory situations.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>DataTerm Link:</strong> This co-processor allows the
								user to directly access and store information from a DataTerm,
								transferring it to a Times Square Marquee, or a LCD screen for
								display (in game terms, this allows the character to access
								information as if a DataTerm were available, even if it isn't).
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							<strong>Interface Plugs:</strong> These are the staple of
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> culture. Usually installed in the bones of the
							wrist, spine or skull, they tap into major nerve trunks and
							interface with the neural processor to send and receive signals.
							The plug itself can be used to insert information and reflex
							"skill chips", or as a plug in for a set of interface cables
							(allowing you to directly control any device you have the proper
							"link" with). In game terms, interface plugs allow the player to
							directly link to many types of machines, such as cybermodems or
							cybervehicles.
						</p>
						<p>
							Interface plugs are quite common; many companies will even pay for
							their installation. Quite a few factory and construction workers
							now "stud" directly into their machines. Interface plugs are
							critical to people like Netrunners (who must have them to gain the
							speed and ability to run the Net), and Solos (who use them to
							operate smartguns).
						</p>
						<p>
							Most people wear their plugs on wrists for ease of use.
							Occasionally, a true cybertechie will mount them at the temples (a
							plug head), just behind the cars (called a frankenstein) or in the
							back of the head (a puppethead). Some cover them with inlaid
							silver or gold caps, others with wristwarmers. Once again, a
							matter of style.
