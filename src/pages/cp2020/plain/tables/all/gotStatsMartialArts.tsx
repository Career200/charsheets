							This skill covers any type of trained fighting style using hands,
							feet, or specialized "martial arts" weapons. You must elect a
							style of martial art and take a separate skill for each style (for
							example, you would have to take Karate and Judo separately,
							spending points for each one. Difficulty modifiers are listed in
							() next tot each skill listed below.
						</p>
						<p>
							The primary advantage to martial arts styles is that each one has
							what are called key attacks; attacks that reflect particular
							strengths of style. When a key attack is used, there is to-hit
							bonus based on the attack type and martial arts style. A full
							table of key attacks is listed in Friday Night.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second advantage to martial arts styles is that there is a
							damage bonus on attacks equal to the level of the Martial Arts
							skill; for example, a master with a +10 Kung Fu Skill would add 10
							points to his damage. This can be formidable advantage,
							particularly in head strikes (which double damage).
