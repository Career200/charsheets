							It's hip and aware to have high tech grafted onto your body
							somewhere. If you can afford it, you probably have at least a
							couple of "enhancements"; a few software chips installed in your
							nervous system to interface with your computer, remember your
							appointments (the ever popular <em>Daytimer</em> chip for
							example), and improve your raquetball reflexes. If you're{' '}
							<em>cybered up</em> you probably have interface plugs to operate
							computers and vehicles mentally. Maybe your eyes are cyberoptics
							with a recording function and the latest iris tint (polychrome is
							in this year), or your hearing is boosted to better hear the
							gossip in the Executive Lounge.

							If your job involves some type of security or combat function (and
							most occupations of the 2000's have at least some type of combat
							aspect), you probably have two or three types of combat software,
							as well as plugs and interfaces for a smartgun. As a Solo, you may
							have had one or more limbs replaced with cyberware prosthetics,
							allowing you to hide a variety of tools and weapons in your body,
							as well as giving you an edge in speed and strength.

							As a cyberpunk, you're going to want to get your hands on the best
							of this exciting and expensive new tech. And expensive is the
							word. The average enhanced character with, say, one cyberoptic
							(Targeting scope &amp; IR enhancement), a reflex boost, one
							superchromed arm with a .25 cal submachinegun, interface plugs and
							chipware for

								<em>Martial Arts</em>

							<a href="028r014b.htm">
								<em>Rotorwing Pilot</em>
							</a>{' '}
							and
							<a href="028r008.htm">
								<em>Handgun</em>
							</a>{' '}
							is an investment of tens of thousands of euro.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of course, the ambitious Punk already knows at least twenty-five
							ways (most of them illegal) to raise that sort of paltry sum.
