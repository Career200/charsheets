							Remember, arms and legs don't grow back. Even if you heal, a
							missing limb will <u>still</u> be missing. You can chose to
							replace it with something out of a Body Banker vat, or you can go
							for the metal. Replacing a limb with either requires a CR surgery
							code. A replacement meat arm will cost about 1,000eb. A
							replacement cyberarm starts at 2,000eb and goes up from there
							depending on what you want to plug into it.
