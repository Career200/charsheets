						<p>Okay, let's start with the basics.</p>
						<p>
							First, you gotta know how to move around. That's easy. Each turn
							in the Net, you can move five spaces, no matter how big those
							spaces are. On the <em>Net World Map</em>. a single space is a
							thousand square miles. On a <em>City Grid Map</em>, a single space
							is about a dozen blocks. On a Subgrid Map (one square of a City
							Grid Map), a single space is roughly a few yards. No matter where
							you are, you still move five spaces per turn.
						</p>
						<p>
							Howzat?? Look, chombatta, in reality, you're not moving at all -
							it's just your point of view that's moving. Think of it like
							you're sending out an eyeball on a long string. The eyeball
							travels, but you don't.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the Net, things move fast. Speeds are measured in nanoseconds,
							not even sec-onds. We meat minds are turtles compared to the big
							systems and the Als. To get things down to a scale we humans can
							comprehend, the Interface program in your deck scales time down to
							match your per-ceptions. In real time, you may have just moved two
							thousand miles in one second. But you just perceive it as
							"teleportation" - zap; you're there. When distances are smaller,
							the Interface program slows things down so that you don't crash
							through the sides of some honcho's data fortress.
						</p>
						<p>Five spaces per one second turn. It's the Law.</p>
						<p>
							Second rule. All travel in the Net is done in straight lines. This
							means you go through the sides of a space, not the corners (see
							illustration). Sure, real people cut the cor-ners alt the time.
							But remember, you aren't really moving at all. The space you're
							not moving through doesn't really "exist", and even if it did, the
							perception of volume is a creation of the old I-G Transformations.
							So you play by the Interface's rules in the Net. Got it?
						</p>
						<p>Okay, so now we're moving.</p>
						<p>
							On the Net World Map, we move by going from one Long Distance Link
							(LDL) to the next. Say you want to go from Night City to London.
							You can't just teleport to London. No, you'll have to go through a
							series of short 5 square hops to get where you want to go.
						</p>
						<p>
							You do this by locating the furthest Long Distance Link (LDL)
							within your five space range. From Night City, this means your
							options would be Salt Lake, Denver, At-lanta, Chicago, New
							York/BosWash, New Orleans and Havana. You couldn't jump the whole
							way; at five spaces per turn, you'd end up stranded in the ocean
							with-out an LDL to stop at.
						</p>
						<p>
							So you jump from Night City to New York. From there, you can
							easily jump to Lon-don; it's five spaces exactly. But wait a
							sec... There's one more thing you need to con-sider. Security
							Levels.
