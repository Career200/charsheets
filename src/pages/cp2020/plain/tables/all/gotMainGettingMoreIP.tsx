							There are three ways to accumulate im-provement Points:
							<em>Study &amp; Practice, Being Taught</em>, and
							<em>Direct Experience</em>. In all three cases, the amount of
							improvement is de-termined by the Referee of your game.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Study &amp; Practice:</strong> in its simplest form, you
							get a how-to book and begin practicing. Study is pretty tough-you
							have no idea of where to begin, and no one to correct your
							mistakes. The biggest limit to this type of learning is that you
							can only improve your skill from a level of +0 to a level of +2.
							In general, it takes about 1 day of book learn-ing to gain 1 IP.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Being Taught:</strong> Finding a teacher is far superior
							to self-teaching or book learning. The teacher must have a higher
							level of skill than the student, and must have the time to teach
							you (how long this takes, of course, is determined by the
							Referee). But even the most knowledgeable of teachers may not be
							able to transfer that knowledge. That's where the skill of
							<a href="028i024.htm">
								<em>Teaching</em>
							</a>{' '}
							comes into play. The teacher must average his skill in the subject
							to be taught with his teach-ing skill. He may then teach the
							student up to that level of skill. How long this takes is, of
							course, up to the Referee, who awards IP over the passage of time
							(usually 1-5 IP per lesson):
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Experience:</strong> Still the best teacher. When-ever you
							do something well, the Referee rewards you with
							<em>Improvement Points</em> right on the spot. The problem is that
							these points will be applied to the skill you were using when you
							got the reward. Therefore, if you want to get better in a
							particular skill, it's important to use that skill every chance
							you get. Referees should use an even hand when rewarding
							<em> Improvement Points</em>, not only rewarding players for doing
							things well, but also for demonstrating both role-playing ability
							and teamwork. In general, we suggest not awarding more than six
							points per skill per game session.
