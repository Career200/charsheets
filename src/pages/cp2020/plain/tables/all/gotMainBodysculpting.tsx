							As long as you're having a few cybernetic grafts put on, why not
							go all the way and redo the whole thing? The art of body-sculpting
							includes skin tints, hair and eye color changes, breast
							enlargement and reduction, and general all-over bodywork. You can
							have bone and muscle removed to become shorter, or have grafts
							added to become taller. Excess fat can be suctioned away, and
							collagen implants can smooth wrinkles, add weight, and change
							contours. Bodysculpting is readily available in a number of body
							salons, including Body-shoppe, Parts N' Programs, and Docs R Us.
							Body sculpting includes appearance changes, appearance
							enhancement, and exotic fashion.

							<strong>Change Appearance:</strong> Looking like a favorite movie
							star or celebrity is a popular fad in 2020; entire gangs, known as
							Posers, often have themselves bodyshaped to resemble famous
							people. Appearance changes are also a staple for Solos, Rockers,
							and any other sort of high mover who needs to change identities
							often. The cost of an appearance change is based on how convincing
							that change is.

							At 1,200eb, you look sort of like you wanted to; a casual observer
							could spot the difference on an AVERAGE Notice check.
						</p>
						<p>
							At 2,400eb, you look very much like you wanted; it would take a
							DIFFICULT Notice check to spot the sculpt job.
						</p>
						<p>
							With 3,600eb, you would look exactly as you wanted to look;
							spotting the sculpt would take a VERY DIFFICULT Notice check.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the top end (5,000 eb), it would require a NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
							check to spot the body-sculpt from your original face.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Increase Attractiveness:</strong> <em>Cyberpunk</em> style
							always goes to the extremes - you're either really ugly or very
							good-looking. One way to increase your Attractiveness is to have
							your body re-designed at the local 'sculpt clinic. The process is
							expensive, granted, but many people think having the right "look"
							for that year is worth a few thousand euro. Cost is 600eb per
							Attractiveness point gained.
							<em>
								For example, to raise my appearance four points would cost
								2,400eb.
							</em>
						</p>

							Want to decrease your Attractiveness? A straight razor costs
							fifty-nine cents.
