							You start the Lifepath. Lifepath is a flowchart of "plot
							complications", designed to help you give your
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> character an authentically dark future
							background. Its seven sections cover national and ethnic origins,
							your family, friend, enemies, personal habits and even key events
							on a yearly basis. It's intended primarily as a guide; if you
							encounter something you don't think fits the character you've
							envisioned, feel free to change the path as you see fit. Use the
							back of your Hardcopy sheet to record your Lifepath. Remember;{' '}
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> hinges on role-playing, so make use of the
							information in your Lifepath run. It's a guaranteed adventure
							generator!
