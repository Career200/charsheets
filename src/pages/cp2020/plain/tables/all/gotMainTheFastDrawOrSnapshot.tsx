							By declaring a fast draw (aka snapshot) at the start of the round,
							you automatically add +3 to your initiative roll, taking a -3
							penalty to hit (you're rushing into combat instead of preparing
							carefully). You also may not take advantage of scope, sights or
							other aiming advantages. The martial arts or melee version of this
							technique is called the iai-jutsu or fighting strike.

								Example: Ripperjack is faced with his long time enemy, Hargan.
								He knows Hargan has a higher REF than he does, so he elects to
								make on all out, blazing attack before the giant can get in a
								move. The snap shooting bonus will give him the +3 advantage he
								needs. Ripperjack's mono-katana arcs out in a searing iai-jutsu
								before Hargan can raise his own sword. Unfortunately, the -3
								point penalty for snapshots works against Ripperjack, and his
								attack misses his opponent by a mile.
