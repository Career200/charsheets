							The skill of eliciting interesting anecdotes from interview
							subject. This information will be of a more non-specific and
							personal nature rather than specific knowledge (distinguishing
							this skill from the skill <em>Interrogation</em>, where the user
							is trying to extract exact information. (Example: Barbara Walters
							interviews, Mike Wallace interrogates). At +3 or better, the
							subject will usually tell you only information relating to what
							he/she is well known for. At +6 or better, the subject will tell
							you anecdotes about the past, pontificate about favorite interests
							and philosophies, etc. At +9 or better, he/she tells you
							everything - including personal information about their
							illegitimate son, the time they stole a cookie at age +4, and the
							fact that no one ever loved them.
