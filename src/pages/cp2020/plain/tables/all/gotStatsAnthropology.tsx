							The knowledge of human cultures, habits and customs. Unlike
							<em>Streetwise</em> (which covers only the culture and customs of
							the Street), or <em>Social</em> (which covers only what you should
							do in a given situation), <em>Anthropology</em> covers general
							customs and background of a culture. For example, with{' '}
							<em>Streetwise</em>, you know what alleys to avoid and what gangs
							are dangerous. With
							<em>Social</em>, you know the proper forms of address for a high
							ranking Japanese <em>zaibatsu</em> head. With{' '}
							<em>Anthropology</em>, you know that the customs of a N'Tanga
							tribesman require that a young man kill a lion in order to be
							accepted as an adult male.
