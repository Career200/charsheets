							Although they don't really count as Netrunner combat, Controllers
							and Utilities deserve a quick mention.
							<strong>
								Controllers can take control of a remote by making a 1D10 roll
								equal to or lower than the Strength of the Controller program.
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Utilities operate by rolling a value equal to or lower than the
								Strength of the Utility program.
							</strong>
							If successful, the Utility performs ifs entire function. For
							example, running a <em>Packer</em> utility will automatically
							reduce the size in MU of any designated program(s) by half.{' '}
							<em>Re-rezz</em> would completely restore a damaged program if
							successful.
