							The human mind can't comprehend a stream of data any more than it
							can "see" an electron. It needs a way to interpret the incoming
							data as something meaningful. So Netrunners use an
							<strong>interface program</strong> -a super-advanced version of
							the more primitive "virtual reality" systems of the 1990's -to
							interpret for them. The interface intercepts data coming through
							the cyberdeck and translates it into something understandable -
							then routes the altered data to the Netrunner's eyes and ears. The
							world perceived through the interface is real, because it directly
							plugs into his senses.
						</p>
						<p>
							So why go through all the trouble to create interfaces? Why not
							just use a keyboard like the rest of the meat minds? Partially for
							the fun of it. But in addition, a realistic and dangerous
							interface gives the Netrunner an extra edge. It keeps him alert,
							involved and interested in his environment. After all; what would
							you react faster to - the word <em>Demon</em> appearing in the air
							in front of you, or a living, breathing, five-ton monster cracking
							a flaming whip over your head?

							The early interfaces were an art form; millions of programming
							hours were devoted each year in constructing accurate and
							interesting realities for Netrunning, using sophisticated
							artificial intelligence programs and random story generators.
							These interface programs functioned on a low end, narrow focus
							bandwidth, which could not carry much more information than an old
							fashioned computer modem of the 1990's. In addition to being
							limited in scope, these early interface programs were also unable
							to give the Netrunner a sense of his position in the real world
							beyond the computer screen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then, in 2014, the wizards of the Net achieved a major
							breakthrough - the Ihara-Grubb Transformation Algorithms. The I-G
							Transformations allowed a cyberdeck to extrapolate the pathways of
							the Net in relation to their "Realspace" coordinates, then
							generate a graphic model that could be perceived by an interface
							program. The results could be used as a navigational aid through
							the Net, as well as providing a sense of space and time not
							possible with earlier designs.
