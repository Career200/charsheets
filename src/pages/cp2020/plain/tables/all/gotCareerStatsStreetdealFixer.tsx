							This is the ability to deal with the underground information
							network. With <em>Streetdeal</em>, a Fixer can uncover rumors and
							information, locate missing persons or things, put gossip out on
							the Street, pick up clues and score big deals. The higher your
							<em>Streetdeal</em> ability, the more information you can gather
							about things happening around you, the more informants you have,
							and the more secretive the information you can dig up. A level +3
							<em>Streetdeal</em> can get you contacts for weapons, tools, or
							minor illegal operations. At level +5, you can penetrate the
							secrets of all but the more powerful crime families. At level +9,
							you are the equivalent of a Mafia crimelord yourself, privy to
							every secret that's on the Street. Apply <em>Streetdeal</em> to
							your Cool stat.
