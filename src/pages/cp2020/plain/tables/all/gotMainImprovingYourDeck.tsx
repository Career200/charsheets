							A standard deck has only one memory. (holds 10 Memory Units (MU),
							or about ten programs), has a Speed of 0, and a data wall Strength
							of 2. While this isn't gonna mean much to you now, by the time you
							get to
							<a className="text-orange-400" href="#">
								<em>Net Combat</em>

							and{' '}
							<a className="text-orange-400" href="#">
								<em>Designing Data Fortresses</em>
							</a>
							, you're going to want to know how to boost your deck as far as
							you can go.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Memory:</strong> For an additional 5,000eb, you can
							purchase an additional memory for your deck. This improves your
							program power to 20 MU, double its stock size.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Speed:</strong> For an additional 2,000eb, you can
							increase your deck's speed by one level, up to a ceiling of 5.
							This can be a lifesaver, as deck speed determines who moves first
							in a Netrunner combat. And in this game, last is dead.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Data Walls:</strong> For an additional 1,000eb, you can
							increase your deck's data wall protection by one level, up to a
							ceiling of 10. Data walls are important; they are the "armor" of
							the deck, resisting attacks from anti-system programs.
