							The skill of hiding in shadows, moving silently, evading guards,
							etc. A <em>Stealth</em> Skill of +1 is about the level of a very
							sneaky 10 year old stealing cookies. At +3, you are able to get
							past most guards, or your parents if you've been grounded. At +6,
							you are good enough to slip smoothly from shadow and not make any
							noise. At +8, you are the equal of most Ninja warriors. At +10,
							you move as silently as a shadow, making the Ninja sound like
							elephants.
