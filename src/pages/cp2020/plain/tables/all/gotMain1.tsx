								As a Cyberpunk, you grab technology by the throat and hang on.
								You've got interface plugs in your wrists, weapons in your arms,
								lasers in your eyes, biochip programs in your brain. You became
								the car you drive, the gun you shot... With cyborged fingers you
								pick computer locks; with enhanced senses, you see into the
								Future.

								The world of Cyberpunk is a violent, dangerous place, filled
								with people whod love to rip your arm off and eat it. The
								traditional concepts of good and evil are replaced by the values
								of expedience you do what you have to do to survive. If you can
								do some good along the way, great.

							<b>But dont count on it.</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Cyberpunk characters are survivors in a though, grim world, faced
							with life and death choices. How they make these choices will have
							a lot to do with whether they end up as vicious animals roaming a
							ruined world, or retain something of their basic humanity.
							Cyberpunk characters are the heroes of a bad situation, working to
							make it better (or at least survivable) whenever they can. Whether
							it takes committing crimes, defying authority or even outright
							revolution, the quintessential Cyberpunk character is a rebel with
							a cause. As a Cyberpunk role-player, its up to you to find that
							cause and go to the wall with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is essence of Cyberpunk playing your character with the
							proper disaffected, cynical-yet-idealistic style. Whether youre a
							biker with leathered skin and metal claws, or a debutante in satin
							sporting the latest in designer cyberoptics, youre going to need a
							certain panache a certain flair, in portraying yourself. To
							achieve the essence of the 2000s, you need to master three
							concepts:
						</p>
						<p>
							1) <b>Style over Substance</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							It doesnt matter how well you do something, as long as you look
							good doing it. If youre going to blow it, make sure you look like
							planned it that way. Normally, clothes and looks dont matter in a
							adventure in this world, having a leather armor jacket and
							mirrorshades is a serious consideration.
						</p>
						<p>
							2) <b>Attitude is Everything</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Its truth. Think dangerous; be dangerous. Think weak; be weak.
							Remember, everyone in the 2000s is carrying lots of lethal
							hardware and high-tech enhancements. They wont be impressed by you
							new H&amp;K smartgun unless you swagger into the club looking like
							you know how to use it and are just itching for an excuse.
						</p>
						<p>
							3) <b>Live on the Edge</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Edge is that nebulous zone where risk takes and highriders go.
							On the Edge, youll risk your cash, your rep, even your life on
							something as vague as a principle or a big score. As a cyberpunk,
							you want to be the action, start the rebellion, light the fire.
							Join great causes and fight for big issues. Never drive slow when
							you can drive fast. Throw yourself up against danger and take it
							head on. Never play too safe. Stay committed to the Edge.
