							Okay, so you don't wanna get all metal-led up and hard into the
							face, heh? No problem. We got a couple of slick little gadgets to
							put you even up with the cybers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>BattleGloves (900.00)</strong>
							<br />
							Heavy gauntlets that cover the entire hand and forearm,
							articulated with artificial muscle and hydraulics. A Battle glove
							delivers 3D6 crushing, 2D6 punching damage, and has three spaces
							for any standard cyberarm weapon or option, except Hydraulic Rams.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Smartgoggles (200.00)</strong>
							<br />
							Want all the advantages of getting cyberoptics, but without the
							humanity loss? Smartgoggles can be outfitted with chips to
							simulate the effects of up to 4 cyberoptic options (each option
							costs the same as a cyberoptic option, less 10%). Smartgoggles
							come with a smartgun plug and cables, allowing the Targeting scope
							option to be used (+ 1 to ranged attacks).
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>
								For example, Razorjack decides to buy a set of Smartgoggles. He
								selects Thermograph, Digital camera, Low Lite and Targeting
								scope as options. His total cost is 200.
							</em>
							<em> (base cost)+990.</em>
							<em>=1190.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Linear Frames (Price Varies)</strong>
							<br />A linear frame is a powered exoskeleton, giving the user
							tremendous strength. There are three levels of linear frames:
							Sigma, Beta and Omega.
						</p>

						<p>
							Normally, exoskeletons are worn as part of a cybernetics package
							(see Putting Cyber Into Punk). However, you can put on a linear
							frame without having it interfaced directly to your nervous
							system. Instead, you can simply chip into the suit as if it were
							any cyberbike or vehicle, taking a -2 REF penalty to do so.
						</p>
						<p>
							Not bad, eh? just make sure they don't take'em off ya, chombatta.
