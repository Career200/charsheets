							This is the ability to call upon the resources and help of any of
							the members of the Nomad's large, extended tribal family. This can
							be in the form of weapons, cash, information, or a small army of
							relatives. The threat of a Nomad family's vengeance may in itself
							stop harm to the Nomad. The higher your <em>Family</em> ability,
							the more important you are to the Family and the more help you can
							call upon. With a<em>Family</em> status +2, you might be able to
							get several of the Pack to help you wreck a town, for example.
							With a status +7 or +8, you are able to make major Pack decisions
							and lead troops. At +10, you may <u>be</u> the Leader of your
							Pack. Family is applied to your Intelligence stat.
