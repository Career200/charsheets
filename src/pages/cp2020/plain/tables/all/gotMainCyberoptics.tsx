						<p>
							A combination of digital processor and camera, cyberoptics are
							replacements for normal eyes. Cybervision is just like regular
							vision, only better. Colors are brighter, images sharper. And
							that's just the start.
						</p>
						<p>
							Want to see life as a 30's black and white movie? No problem.
							Telescopic or microscopic vision? Optional. Infrared and low light
							vision? Standard for Solos.
						</p>
						<p>
							Cyberoptics can look exactly like normal eyes, although a wide
							variety of fashion iris colors are available (amber, white,
							burgundy and violet are very popular). Some versions are
							transparent, with glitter or lights swirling inside of them. Other
							are superchromed for a more "cyber" look. Others can change eye
							color at will or to match clothes and surroundings. Some even have
							tiny designer logos around the iris. Cyberoptics with cameras or
							weapons usually load from the front, with the iris opening up when
							the front of the eye is depressed.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Color Shift:</strong> These cyberoptics can shift color or
							iris pattern on demand. A full color shift takes about a minute.
							Mirrored, transparent, glitter tilted or lighted versions are also
							available.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Infrared:</strong> Allows user to see in near total
							darkness, using heat emissions for image reception.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Times Square Marquee:</strong> Scrolling red-letter screen
							in upper edge of vision, linked to either a software chip readout
							or a radio link.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Targeting Scope:</strong> This projects a targeting sight
							into the field of vision at will. The targeting scope will read
							range to specific objects, speed of movement, bearing and size, as
							well as providing several types of scope reticle for aligning
							weapons. When chipped into a smartgun, the scope will match the
							targeting sensors of the gun with what you are looking at, then
							flash a "ready signal" when the target is acquired. In game terms,
							this option allows you to add +1 only to smartgun attacks.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Anti-dazzle protection:</strong> Auto stepdown compensates
							for harsh sunlight, flares, etc., neutralizing effects from
							strobes, flashbombs and bright headlights. Never need sunglasses
							again.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Low-Lite:</strong> Allows user to see clearly in dim fight
							conditions, down to very faint moonlight or distant street lamps.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Image Enhancement:</strong> High-res graphics capability
							allows user to enhance and refine images viewed. When activated,
							increases Awareness skill by +2, allowing user to pick up visual
							cues in greater detail.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Thermograph Sensor:</strong> Allows user to see heat
							patterns of objects, people. Cooler things show up as dark to
							light blue, hotter things as red or orange, and the hottest of all
							as yellow or white. Used to distinguish differing heat sources
							through lights structural material, or the presence of cybernetics
							(which are always cooler than normal body temperatures). Can also
							determine the operating time of certain machinery by measuring its
							cooling gradient.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Dartgun:</strong> One shot dartgun. Range of 1 meter, +2
							WA. Poison dart will penetrate up to SP6 automatically. SP8 50%
							chance, soft armors only. Takes 3 spaces.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Micro-Optics:</strong> This is the equivalent of a
							laboratory microscope, allowing the user to see microscopic
							images, such as fingerprints, scratches on locks, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Teleoptics:</strong> This is the equivalent of a 20x power
							telescope, allowing the user to see distant objects clearly.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Ultra Violet:</strong> This system allows the user to
							perceive images irradiated by ultraviolet light, or to detect
							florescent powders or tracing agents, or to use ultraviolet
							flashlights (indetectable by normal optics) for illumination.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>MicroVideo:</strong> This is a cyberoptic mounted video
							camera which records its view on an internal video tape (20min).
							This recorder can also be downloaded through interface plugs to an
							external source. Takes up two option spaces.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Digital Camera:</strong> This cyberoptic mounted camera
							takes up two option spaces. Up to 20 images can be recorded on the
							built-in digital chip and downloaded through interface cables to
							an external recorder, internal recorder, or an internal LCD
							screen. As new pictures are taken, the previous ones are erased.
