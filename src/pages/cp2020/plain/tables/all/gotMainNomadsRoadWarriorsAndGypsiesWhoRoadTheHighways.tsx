							They drove your family off the Farm ten years ago. The
							Corporations rolled in, took over the land, and put rent-a-cops
							all over the place. It wasn't the first time it'd happened; it
							wouldn't be the last. Gradually, your family fell in with a bunch
							of other homeless families, and they met another group... until
							you'd create a Nomad pack of nearly two hundred members.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, busses and
							RV's, your Nomad pack roams the freeways. You look for supplies,
							odd jobs and spare parts in the world where society has
							fragmented. The pack is your home - it has teachers, Med Techs,
							leaders, and mechanics - it's virtually a town on wheels in which
							everyone is related by marriage or kinship. Sometimes the Pack
							pulls into a town just to fuel up or get grub. Other times, it
							swings south to follow the harvest; you pick crops in trade for
							cash or food. Less terrorizing cities and hiring out as muscle in
							Corporate wars. For obvious reasons, the cops don't like Nomads.
							But it doesn't matter - your vehicle are usually well armored and
							bristling with stolen weapons; mini guns, rocket launchers and the
							like. Every kid knows how to use rifle, and everyone packs a
							knife. Being homeless in the 2000's isn't easy.
						</p>
						<p>
							The most visible members of the Pack are the Scouts - leather
							armored riders on bikes or in fast muscle cars, who protect the
							convoy from attacks and hunt up safe campsites. As a Scout, you're
							on the lookout for trouble, and you usually can find enough of it,
							with rival Nomad Packs, the Law, and the cowboy, you ride the hard
							trail. You've got a gun, a bike and that's all you need. You're a
							Nomad.
