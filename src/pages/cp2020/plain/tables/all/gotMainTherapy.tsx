							There's one way to hang out over the Edge and still keep it wired,
							and that's therapy. The C-SWAT drags you in, screaming and tearing
							at the walls, and straps you down to a heavy metal psychatrist's
							couch. Probes deactivate your cybersystems one by one, while the
							shrink jacks your rabid psyche into the braindance. Then begins
							the long, arduous process of disassembling your brain and
							reconstructing it in a more socially acceptable form. One that
							doesn't get its kicks out of eating dead bodies, for example.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Cyberpsychologists</strong> (Psychoshrinks) use
							combinations of braindance simulation, drugs, hypnotics,
							psychosurgery and aversion therapy to reconstruct damaged
							personalities. Once all cybernetics are removed or deactivated,
							the character will recover two points of EMP for every week of
							therapy attended.

								total of -3. It will take at least five weeks of therapy before
								Savage will be bock to his original Empathy of 6.
