							The ability to intimidate and control others through your position
							as Lawmen. This attribute represents the Cop's ability to call on
							the forces of the Law and Government to get what he wants. Cops
							can use
							<em>Authority</em> to question suspects, arrest wrongdoers, and
							defend innocents. Backed by the power of <em>Authority</em>, a cop
							can arrest, detain, confiscate and enter nearly anywhere, as long
							as he has the proper arrest or search warrants to back his play.
							However, authority is only as good as guy holding badge - if the
							cop appears uncertain of his <em>Authority</em> there's a good
							chance he'll get nailed by the people his trying to confront, the
							more able you are to face down criminals, particularity high level
							mobsters and officials. Authority is applied to your Cool stat.
