							You were reborn with a gun in your hand - the flesh and blood
							hand, not the metallic weapon factory the covers most of your arm.
							Whether as a freelance guard and killer-for-hire, or as one of the
							Corporate cybersoldiers that enforce business deals and the
							Company's "black operations", you're one of the elite fighting
							machines if the Cyberpunk world.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most Solos have put in military time, either in a Corporate army
							or in one of the Government's continual "police actions" around
							the world. As the battle damage piles up, you start to rely more
							and more upon hardware - cyberlimbs for weapons and armor,
							bio-program chips to increase your reflexes and awareness, combat
							drugs to give you that edge over your opponents. When you're the
							best of the best, you might even leave the ranks of Corporate
							samurai and go ronin - freelancing your lethal talents as killer,
							bodyguard or enforcer to whoever can pay your very high fees.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sounds good? There's a price - a heavy one. You're lost so much of
							your original meat body that you're almost a machine, Your killing
							reflexes are so jacked up that you have to restrain yourself from
							going berserk at any moment. Years of combat drugs taken to keep
							the edge have given you terrifying addictions. You can't trust
							anyone - your mother, your friends, your lovers - no one. One
							night you sleep in penthouse condo in the City - the next in a
							filthy alley on the Street. But that's the price of being the
							best.
						</p>
						<p>And you're willing to pay it. Because you're a Solo.</p>
