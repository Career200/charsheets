						<p>
							If you live to rock, this is where you belong. Rockerboys are the
							street poets, social consciences and rebels of 2000's. With the
							advent of digital porta-studios and garage laser disk mastering,
							every Rocker with a message can take it to the street; put in the
							record stores, bounce it off the comsats.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sometimes, this message isn't something the Corporations or
							Government wants to hear. Sometimes what you say is going to get
							right in the faces of the powerful people who really run this
							world. But you don't care, because as a Rockerboy, you know it's
							your place to challenge, whether in straight-out protest songs
							that tell it like it is, or just by playing kick-ass rock'n'roll
							to get the people away from TV sets and into the Streets. You have
							a proud history as a Rockerboy - Dylan, Springsteen, Who, Elvis,
							the Stones - the legions of hardrock heroes who told the truth
							with screaming guitars and gut-honest lyrics.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a Rockerboy, you have the power to get the people up - to lead,
							inspire and inform. A song from you can give the timid courage,
							the weak strength, and blind vision. Rockerboy legends have led
							armies against Corporations and Governments. Rockerboy songs have
							exposed corruption, brought down dictators. It's a lot of power
							for a guy doing gigs every night in another city. But you can
							handle it. After all - you came to play!
