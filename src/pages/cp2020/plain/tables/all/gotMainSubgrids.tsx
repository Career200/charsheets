							This is where most of your Netrunning action takes place. Once
							you've jumped through the LDLs and located your target on the City
							Grid, your netrunner will move to the specific Subgrid where that
							system is to check it out.
						</p>
						<p>
							A <strong>Subgrid Map</strong> covers about twelve square blocks,
							and is divided up into 10 meter squares. A system or Data Fortress
							(a heavily armored system) is con-structed by filling up adjacent
							squares of the Subgrid in a sort of loose building form. The shape
							of the Data Fortress on paper is only roughly like ifs real
							appear-ance; systems can be shaped like Corpo-rate Logos, colored
							polygons, Realspace buildings, abstract shapes or even
							person-alities (such as Disney's titanic Mickey Mouse-shaped Data
							Fortress in the Chiba/ Tokyo region).
						</p>
						<p>
							When designing a{' '}
							<a className="text-orange-400" href="#">
								<em>Data Fortress</em>
							</a>
							, Referees should make some attempt to make the shape on the map
							roughly correspond to what the actual Netspace ICON of the
							fortress is, if only to make it easier on your players.
						</p>
						<p>
							As in all Net movement, 'Runners move at a rate of five squares
							per turn. Movement, of course, is in straight lines, and cannot
							(obviously) pass through an obstacle unless you blast it to
							oblivion first.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you're down to the subgrid level, Netrunning becomes pretty
							simple. You try to get into the Data Fortress, either by getting
							through a Code Gate, or by blasting through a wall. Once inside,
							you move from place to place, looking for Memories to loot and
							other useful things. Along the way, you'll encounter various
							anti-intrusion programs and traps, all of which are programmed to
							do something nasty to you, your software, or your deck. You'll
							launch your own counter programs to stop them from frying
							something important.
