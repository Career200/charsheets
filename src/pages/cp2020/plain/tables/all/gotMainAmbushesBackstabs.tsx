							Sometimes, the best way to deal with a very powerful opponent is
							to get the drop on him from behind; in short, setting an ambush.
							Ambushes gain a +5 to hit advantage. You may ambush or backstab by
							announcing your intent to hide or lie in ambush for a target. You
							can elect to set up an ambush any time:
						</p>
						<p>
							a) The opponent is unaware of your location and your intention to
							attack. This can be accomplished by setting up a hiding place
							ahead of time or taking advantage of a melee to get under cover
							and waiting for a shot. A victim of an ambush must make an
							Awareness roll greater than your <em>Stealth</em> Skill + INT +
							1D10, or you have automatically succeeded.
						</p>
						<p>
							b) The opponent's attention is on another situation, such as
							another attack or a task requiring great concentration. This can
							be accomplished by creating a distraction for your opponent, or by
							sneaking up on him while he is in combat with another combatant.

							An ambush doesn't mean you act first - it just means you have an
							attack advantage. Initiative for the round is made as usual, and
							the ambushing character can spring the trap on his part of the
							round or can wait to see what develops before making his attack.
							Until the attack is made, his opponent may not attack him, because
							he doesn't know he's in danger. An ambush may only be used for one
							attack; another ambush must be set up before the bonus can be
							employed again.

								Example: Ripperjack decides to set up an ambush in a dark alley
								of the City. He rolls his Stealth Skill + lnt + 1D10 for a total
								of 18. Along come Scarr and Hargan, his mortal enemies.
							</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>
								At the start of the combat turn, initiative is Scarr, Ripperjack
								and Hargan. As they enter the trap, both Scarr and Hargan make
								Awareness Rolls. Scarr's roll is 12; Morgan's is 20. "It's a
								trap'' yells Hargan, but too late; Scarr didn't know what was
								coming and couldn't declare an attack or defense. Ripperjack
								pegs him with a shot from his H&amp;K Hellfire, using the +5
								Ambush bonus. He won't get the bonus on Hargon, because the
								blond giant mode his Awareness roll and spotted him. His second
								shot misses, and Horgon throws himself down behind a wrecked car
								and opens up with his 20mm autocannon. Savage fades down the
								alleyway to set up another trap.
