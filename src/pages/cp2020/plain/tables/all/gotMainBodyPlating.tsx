							Body plating covers any situation where armored plastics and
							metals are layered over and directly anchored to the skin. The
							armor is microscopically porous, allowing the skin underneath to
							breathe, and made by sandwiching an ablative plastic shell with
							energy absorbing micro cellular honeycomb.
						</p>
						<p>
							Body plating doesn't make you any stronger or faster, but it's
							perfect for the cyborg who wants all over protection all the time
							- and doesn't care who knows it. It is the ultimate expression of
							the "metal is better than meat" philosophy; the body-plated look
							more like robots than they do humans, and are impervious to most
							of the physical damage that besets us mere mortals. Body plating
							also includes specialized mounts for sensors as well as body
							armor.
						</p>
						<p>
							Body plating is sold in parts, each covering a specific area. It
							may be placed directly on the skin, or layered over a linear frame
							exoskeleton for the ultimate in cyborg chic.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Cowl:</strong> This is a body plate that covers the skull.
							It is anchored by mini-bolts to the scalp, and resembles the old
							skullcaps from bad science fiction or fantasy epics. SP=25.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Faceplate:</strong> The standard faceplate covers the
							entire face, with ports for breathing, eating and seeing. The
							armored plastic material is woven with fine myomar muscle fibers
							and is relatively flexible. Facial nervelinks allow limited (and
							somewhat stiff) changes of expression. This modification doesn't{' '}
							<em>have</em> to be ugly; many people find the silvery contours
							and smooth features quite attractive; somewhat like the "sexy
							robot" airbrushings of the late 20th century. However, many
							cyborgs like to have their faceplates sculpted into bizarre and
							often frightening images; monsters out of mythology, or terrifying
							robotic shapes. It's up to you. SP=25.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Torso Plate:</strong> This section covers the entire upper
							and tower torso, back and front, with expansion joints at the
							sides, groin and waist to allow free movement. (SP=25). Reduce
							your REF by -3.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Front Optic Mount:</strong> This mount allows up to five
							cyberoptics to be installed in a shielded cluster in the upper
							face. The eyes are removed and the orbital sockets used to mount
							the receiver hardware for the optic mount. Optic mounts come in
							several styles: there are thin visor slits (ala Robocop), rotating
							camera clusters (like an old fashioned movie camera), or one main
							optic with smaller ones arranged in a circle around it. Needless
							to say, this really screws up your attractiveness stat,
							automatically reducing it to -1.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Sensory Extensions:</strong> These are flattened antennae
							and optic mounts, about a foot to two feet long. A single
							cyberoptic and a microphone are mounted in the tip, allowing you
							to observe things around corners without sticking your whole body
							into the line of fire. Sensory "booms" are usually mounted on the
							head or on the upper spine.
