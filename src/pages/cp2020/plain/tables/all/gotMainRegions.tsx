							Regions (also nicknamed "kingdoms"), are large areas on the world
							NET map (such as <em>Atlantis</em> in the southern
							Atlantic/African Basin). They are referred to by name. A Region is
							a hazy zone of shifting boundaries; new regions pop up all the
							time, and the boundaries constantly change as potential Net
							reality shifts. It's not really a <em>place</em>; just a rough
							definition of an area where certain groups or governments have the
							most control. Regions include:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Atlantis:</strong> This is the second largest of the
							regional kingdoms, stretching from Central and South America to
							the west coast of Africa. The region is primarily controlled by
							the Central American Federation and its allied corporations. Key
							City Grids are located in Mexico City, Panama City, Bogota,
							Havana, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Dakar and Acension. Atlantis
							is a fairly freewheeling region, with a lot of black-market trade,
							especially out of Panama City.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Rustbelt:</strong> This region covers the Central and
							Eastern United States. Key City Grids are the New York/BosWash
							Megaplex, Chicago-GreatLakes, Atlanta-CityCore, New Orleans, and
							St. Louis. The region is a near absolute dictatorship controlled
							by a troika of NetWatch (the worldwide Net security organization),
							the U.S. Provisional Government, and the EuroMarket Consortium.
							Systems are heavily monitored and computer crime treated with
							draconian ferocity.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Olympia:</strong> The Olympia Region spans most of the
							Southwestern and Western United States. Nominally, it is the
							domain of NetWatch and the United States Provisional Government.
							Individual city grids are usually controlled on a local level by
							the most prominent Corporation in the area; Denver (Orbital Air),
							Salt Lake (Militech), Dallas/Houston Megaplex (WorldSat),
							Albuquerque (Militech). Most of the traffic in these regions is
							corporate related, with many established bulletin boards and
							service networks.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Pacifica:</strong> This is the largest of the regions,
							covering the West Coast of North America and expanding over most
							of the Pacific Basin. As with Olympia, it is under the joint
							rulership of NetWatch and the USPG to the edge of the Hawaiian
							Basin; at this point, there is a four way division between
							NetWatch, USPG, Arasaka LTD. and the Far Asian Co-Prosperity
							Federation. In the US, most key City Grids are controlled by the
							most powerful corps in the specific city; Night City (Arasaka),
							San Francisco (EBM), Los Angeles (Petrochem), Seattle (Arasaka).
							In these cities, control is relatively loose. Across the Pacific
							Basin, control increases as Arasaka tightens its grip.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>TokyoChiba:</strong> This is a very small region covering
							the Japanese archipelago, specifically Tokyo, Osaka and Yokahama.
							Chiba is the center of operations for a number of very powerful
							zaibatsu, including Mitzubishi-Dai, Matsushima-Kiroshiu, and of
							course, Arasaka. However, due to the immense amount of
							inter-zaibatsu warfare, no one megacorp holds control, making this
							a ripe field for information brokering and corporate
							"netspionage".
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Afrikani:</strong> This regional "kingdom" extends from
							the edge of Atlantis across Africa to the Middle East and
							Madagascar. Key City Grids are Addis Ababa, Zanzibar, Cairo,
							Algiers, Nairobi, Mozambique and Alexandria. With the exception of
							Nairobi and Cairo (under firm Orbital Air control), the rest of
							Afrikani is a chaotic wasteland of antiquated systems, shirting
							alliances and fanatics. Caution is advised.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>EuroTheatre:</strong> This most powerful of the regional
							"kingdoms", EuroTheatre is primarily controlled by the EuroCorps.
							Key City Grids are London, Paris, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich,
							Zurich, Amsterdam, Rome, Madrid and Stockholm. The three largest
							EuroCorps in each city work in cooperation with NetWatch to
							maintain security. The EuroTheatre Net is dominated by corporate
							traffic; there are few private systems and most independent
							Netrunners are already known and recorded by NetWatch. EuroTheatre
							is a good place for legal business transactions, banking,
							Netconferencing and other legitimate transactions. It is a very,
							very bad place to commit computer crime.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>SovSpace:</strong> This region covers the borders of the
							now reduced Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, extending into
							Eastern Europe. Key City Grids are Moscow, Leningrad, Warsaw,
							Kiev, Budapest, Vienna, and Prague. The USSR holds nominal control
							over this region, with control gradually shifting to NetWatch and
							the European Economic Community around Poland. Systems in SovSpace
							tend to be primitive, slow and equipped with a few deadly programs
							rather than sophisticated defenses. The Eastern European
							netrunners range from simple hackers alt the way to the most
							daring cowboys in all Netspace (these guys have nothing to lose).
							The entire region is rife with espionage, information trading, and
							the petty bickering of small political groups looking for their
							own economic advantages. A good place to sell information, if you
							don't mind being paid in low value currency.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Orbitsville:</strong> The largest potential region,
							covering the Low Earth and Near Earth Space. Orbitsville is a
							great place to meet people, pick up rumors and generally have a
							good ol' time. Security is loose to nonexistent Orbitsville is
							primarily controlled by the Orbital Corporations and the ESA
							(which has it's own version of NetWatch). There's not a lot of
							"groundhog" traffic - orbital time lag (2-3 seconds) makes
							Netrunning from Groundside a tough proposition. Local traffic is
							very busy, with every Spacer habitat and colony hooked up to a
							constant stream of chatter. Transactions are mostly on the small
							time level: trading raw materials, medicine, air, food, water and
							gossip.
