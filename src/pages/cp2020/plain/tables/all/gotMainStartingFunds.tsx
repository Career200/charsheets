							So how much do you start with? Well, that depends on your job.
						</p>
						<p>
							A job? Yeah, even in the Dark Future, ya gotta pay the bills,
							chombatta. And you <em>want</em> a job, because it's a real short
							slip between being able to eat Realpack and fresh veggies, and
							being reduced to eating kibble and living in a filthy flop-cube.
						</p>
						<p>
							How good a job you cur-rently have is based on the level of your
							Special Abil-ity. For example, a Rocker with a
							<a href="030b.htm">Charismatic Leadership</a> of 2 isn't gonna
							draw crowds like Kerry Eurodyne (a hot megarocker). This means
							he'll be reduced to playing gigs wherever he can get them;
							sleazoid dives, bar-mitz-vahs, weddings, bar fights; you name it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Take a quick jump to the <a href="037a.htm">Occupation Table</a>.
							Find your Role (or the role closest to it), cross reference it to
							your current <em>Special Ability</em> level, and that'll give you
							a monthly salary. Multiply this amount by a 1D6/3 to determine the
							number of months you've currently been employed, and that gives
							you the total amount of cash your character starts with.
						</p>
						<p>
							Exactly how you earn your euro is up to you; the categories are
							deliberately vague to give you plenty of roleplaying room. Maybe
							as "Level 7" Solo, you don' t want to work for a Corporation; no
							problem. It's only a general description of where you fit on the
							Solo hierarchy. For all we know, you work on an extraction team
							for
							<em>Amnesty International</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
							One last thing. Roll one more D6. if you roll higher than a four,
							you just got unem-ployed.
						</p>
						<p>Congratulations. Betcha can taste that kibble already.</p>
