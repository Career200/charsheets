							In most cases, encumbrance isn't a big problem for a
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> character - he's going to keep the majority of
							his gear in his apartment or his car. A <em>Cyberpunk</em>{' '}
							character can carry around as much in kilograms as the number of
							points invested in his Body Type stat, multiplied by 10. He can
							deadlift 40 times his Body Type stat.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>
								Example: I have spent 6 points to get an Average Body Type. I
								con carry up to 60 kilograms; roughly 132 Ibs. I can deadlift
								240 kg - about 528 Ibs.

							Rather than list exact weights of everything you could possibly
							want to carry, we have arranged a simpler system of
							classification. The following weight groups are more useful to the
							Referee who must make a general determination of how much a player
							can carry.
