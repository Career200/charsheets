							So what do you need to run the Net besides a cool brain and a hot
							interface? Plugging into the vast metaverse of the Net requires
							two additional and all important pieces of hardware.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first is a set of neural or interface "plugs." interface plugs
							are basically just that - plastic plugs built into the Netrunner's
							wrists, temples or back of neck, to be connected to a cybermodem
							by cables (as described in
							<a className="text-orange-400" href="#">
								<em>Putting the Cyber Into the Punk</em>
							</a>
							).
						</p>
						<p>
							You can get by without plugs; all you'll need is a
							<a className="text-orange-400" href="#">
								<em>set of 'trodes</em>
							</a>
							. These are self sticking electrodes that pick up neural signals
							by skin inductance. They're slower and less responsive than plugs
							(-2 to REF while in the Net), but they are cheaper and don't have
							any humanity cost.
						</p>
						<p>The other thing you'll need is a cyberdeck.</p>
