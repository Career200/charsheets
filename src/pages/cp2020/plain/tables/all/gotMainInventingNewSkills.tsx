							You can also invent new skills to cover new needs, should you want
							to do so. To do so, you must first convince the Referee of your
							game to let you have that skill. You and the Referee should work
							together to deter-mine:
						</p>
						<p>
							1) Exactly <strong>what</strong> does this skill allow you to do?
							<br />
							2) <strong>How</strong> (according to your character conception)
							did you acquire this skill?
							<br />
							3) What are the specific limits of this skill (what can't I do
							with it?).
							<br />
							4) What stat is this skill connected to and why?
						</p>
						<p>
							Referees should be careful to make sure that player skills are
							neither too specific ("Shoot .45 Caliber Handgun With Laser
							Sight"), or too general ("Shoot Anything Well"). You should insist
							on a middle ground which covers a general ability to use the
							skill, yet does not give the player an unreasonable advantage in
							all possible situations ("Shoot Handguns"). The Referee is always
							the final arbiter of decisions on skills.
