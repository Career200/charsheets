						<p>
							As late as the 1990's there were still used models of the
							venerable Beretta and Webley for sale (particularly in pawnshops
							and on the black market). The same can be as-sumed for 20th
							century weapons in 21st century- large numbers of "obsolete"
							weapons that can be found at reasonable prices in any pawn shop.
							Prices are usually half that of a comparable new weapon of the
							type, although final price is up to the Referee.

								<br />P 1 J C 2D6+ 3 (.3S7) 6 2 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							Designed for US Border Patrol use. the Combat Magnum is a popular
							choice among police officers. Its "small frame" and reliable
							action make it a best seller.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Liama Commanche
								<br />P 0 J C 4D6 (.44) 6 1 ST
							</strong>
							<br />
							An excellent .44 revolver, used in home defense and police work.

						</p>
						<p>

								Colt .45 "Peacemaker"
								<br />P 0 J R 2D6+2 (.45) 6 1 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							The gun "that won the West", the .45 was the most common US
							sidearm throughout the 1800's. A single action weapon, it must be
							cocked before firing, although later models had a flattened hammer
							allowing the gun to be fired by "fanning" the hammer.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Colt .38 Detective
								<br />P 1 J C 1D6+ 2 (.38) 6 1 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							The most commonplace police weapon for many years, the Colt .38
							has many variants, including the smaller "Chief's Special". With
							their high reliability, there are many of these guns still in
							circulation.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								C.O.P. .357 Derringer
								<br />
								P 0 P C 2D6+3 (.357) 4 2 VR
								<br />{' '}

							unique revolving firing pin arrangement. It's small size makes it
							easily hidden.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								UZI
								<br />
								SMG 2 J C 2D6+1 (9mm) 30 20 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							Developed by the Israelis as a reliable export weapon, the Uzi is
							used worldwide by security forces, the US Secret Service, police
							and (unfortunately) terrorists and drug dealers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Vz61 Skorpion
								<br />
								SMG 2 J P 1D6 (.25) 20 25 VR
							</strong>
							<br />A standard military sidearm for the Soviet Bloc, the
							Skorpion is the worid's smallest military SMG. It's small
							ammunition size gives it excellent controllability. It is easily
							silenced and can be carried in a shoulder holster.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Ingram MAC 10
								<br />
								SMG -1 J C 2D6+2 (.45) 30 S UR
							</strong>
							<br />A very small SMG used by covert units and terrorists. It can
							be easily silenced. However, it's very large ammo size makes it
							very difficult to control when on full auto.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								H&amp;K MPS &amp; MP5K
								<br />
								SMG 1 L C 2D6+1 (9mm) 30 20 ST
							</strong>
							<br />
							Two examples of the H&amp;K family of interchangeable SMGs, both
							share parts and design similarities. The MP5K is a very small
							version of the MP55D3, which has a built in silencer.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Thompson M1
								<br />
								SMG 2 N C 2D6+2 (.45) 30 20 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							Standard US military SMG during WWII, the Thompson is rugged,
							reliable and easy to use. The M1928 version, of gangster fame, was
							less reliable (UR), but could carry a 5O round drum magazine.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Bushmaster
								<br />
								SMG 0 C R 4D6 (5.56) 30 20 ST
							</strong>
							<br />A bullpup configured SMG designed to be fired one handed.
							The Bushmaster uses the M-16A1 clip, making it technically closer
							to an assault rifle than a submachinegun.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								FN-FAL
								<br />
								RIF 0 N E 6D6+2 (7.56) 20 21 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							Standard NATO rifle. A very deadly assault weapon, durable and
							handles well.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								AK 47, AKM, AKMS
								<br />
								RIF 0 N E 5D6 (7.565) 30 20 VR
							</strong>
							<br />
							Standard Soviet military rifle, exported worldwide, particularly
							to Soviet client-slates. Reliable, rugged, but rather difficult to
							control, the AK-47 is probably the most well known weapon of it's
							type in the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								M-16A &amp; M-16A2
								<br />
								RIF 2 N C 4D6 (5.56) 30 25 UR
							</strong>
							<br />
							Standard US military rifle since the 1960's, the M-16 has high
							accuracy and a staggering ROF. A built in "tumble" effect
							compensates for the light 5.56 round. Earlier M-16 models were
							cantankerous and unreliable in the extreme, with an accuracy of 1,
							not 2. The Ar-15 and the AR-180 are civilian models used by police
							and home defense.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Styer Aug
								<br />
								RIF 2 N C 4D6 (5.56) 30 20 VR
							</strong>
							<br />A bullpup configured rifle using high tech plastics and
							aluminum, the AUG is the wave of the future. The scope is built
							in, giving it great accuracy, while it's rugged plastic
							construction gives it reliability and strength.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>
								Winchester M70
								<br />
								RIF 3 N C 5D6+ 1 (30-06) 5 1 VR
							</strong>
							<br />A basic scoped hunting rifle, used to hunt deer.
