							<em>Medical</em> Tech skill assumes that the character has studied
							medicine in a professional setting. This gives him the ability to
							perform surgery, prescribe drugs, and know the proper treatment of
							injuries. He can replace damaged organs with vatgrown pieces,
							graft on new limbs, or install cyber-limbs. You cannot perform
							Medical Tech skills on yourself.
						</p>
						<p>
							A character with <a href="030h.htm">Medical Tech</a> skills makes
							a check as if using the <a href="028t011.htm">First Aid</a> skill,
							however, with <em>Medical Tech</em>, the patient will recover at
							the rate of 1 point per day. For example, a light wound would be
							healed in 4 days. A Mortal 3 wound would heal in 28 days. Using
							Medical Tech skills supersedes the use of First Aid skills; a
							patient on which both have been successfully performed regains
							points at the rate of 1 per day, not 1.5! As with First Aid, the
							patient regains no points until a successful roll has been made.
							However, second attempts may be made once per day until a
							successful roll is made.
