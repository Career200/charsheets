							<strong>Damage</strong> in combat is determined by rolling groups
							of six-sided dice. If a rule says, "roll 2D6", for example, you
							would roll two six sided dice, total the results, and apply the
							total to the target you were attacking. If the rule said "roll
							2D6+1", you would roll as above, then add 1 to the total.
						</p>
						<p>
							So much for creating damage. Let's take a step-by-step look at how
							to
							<em>apply</em> it.
