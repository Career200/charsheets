							Just about this time, you're starting to look over the list of
							cyber-enhancements, and you're thinking, "I don't have the kind of
							Eurobucks. I need to swing this newtech". At this point, you have
							to ask yourself "How desperate am I? Am I really hard up enough to
							risk death and dismemberment just to get a lousy cyberarm?"
						</p>
						<p>Sure you are.</p>
						<p>
							The truly desperate turn to desperate measures. In this case, you
							can hire yourself out to someone who can afford to buy your
							cybernetics for you. Selecting any one of the following employers
							is worth 10,000 Eurodollars in cybernetics, free of charge:

							Become a fighter in the Cyberwars, serving your country's armed
							forces with distinction and honoras part of its secret Elite
							Mechanized Combat Forces (Cybergrunts, to you). See pain, torture
							and death close up, as you participate in any one of a hundred
							covert "police actions" worldwide, protecting "national
							interests". Of course the Cybergrunts don't exist. Of course your
							country doesn't send teams of heavily armed covert agents into
							other countries to kill and foment revolt. Of course they're not
							going to let you quit when you want to.

							The word on the Street is that the Mob is alive and hiring. Swear

							"work" for them. Bill collecting. Assassinations. Murders. Mob
							wars. The Families of 2020 have a long and honorable tradition
							that goes back into the early twentieth century: nobody ever quits
							the Mob. Ever.

							Join a Corporation and see the world. While you're at it, they'll
							bankroll you for ten thousand dollars in newtech. But remember,
							with all business deals there's a price. In this case, you have to
							work for the Corporation. The jobs you get to do are all the fun,
							suicidal ones on which they don't want to waste their good people
							executive kidnappings, black operations and espionage missions if
							you're really lucky, you'll even get to be a grunt in a Corporate
							war - you know, the ones that make Vietnam and Afghanistan look
							like picnics, where you get to defend the Corporation's interests
							in some backwater hellhole with a population of natives you're
							suppressing.

						<p>
							Like most "free" offers, these employment opportunities are
							boobytrapped in creative and dangerous ways. Each requires that
							you work for an indeterminate amount of time (forever) for people
							you may not like. You'll have to do what they tell you, no matter
							how cruddy, dangerous or suicidal. Like most powerful people in
							the Cyberpunk future, they don't like to be crossed, and have a
							variety of awful ways to ensure your "cooperation".
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Hostages:</strong> To ensure your good behavior, the
							controlling agency is holding someone you care about hostage. You
							mess up, they die - or worse.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Blackmail:</strong> Somewhere in your past, you did
							something you can't afford to let out It could be as small as
							cheating on your taxes (with a 20-year jail term), or a murder
							rap. It may even be fictional - created by your new employers to
							make sure you toe the line. Are you willing to take the chance?
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Sabotage Chipware:</strong> To make sure you stay in line,
							the controlling agency has buried lethal glitches in your
							cybernetic software. Things to make your heart stop on command.
							Programs that give you blinding headaches if you refuse to follow
							an order.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Monitored:</strong> Your employers have implanted sensors
							or other monitoring devices on you - just to ensure your loyalty.
							You can't say or do anything without them knowing. You can't go
							anywhere without them finding you. The worst part is, you don't
							know where in your body they've hidden these devices.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Command Kill:</strong> A realty vicious sabotage chip - on
							the command word, you will kill whomever you are directed to kill
							- without control, regret or mercy. Your mother. Your lover. Your
							cat. Anyone.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Company Safeguard:</strong> Another nasty sabotage chip.
							You can't willingly harm any member of the controlling agency - to
							do so will cause you excruciating pain. To continue will cause
							even more pain, culminating in full heart stoppage and a screaming
							death.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Remote Detonator:</strong> One of the favorite corporate
							tricks this is a small package of inert explosive buried somewhere
							in your body, activated by a remote radio signal. You don't know
							where they put it, the scanners can't find it, and if you did go
							around looking, you're likely to set it off (60%) Wanna bet your
							life, cobber?
						</p>
						<p>
							Sounds fun? Remember, if you join one of these groups, any one (or
							more) of these little goodies applies directly to making you a
							puppet of your employers. What you are forced to do, and what they
							hold over you, is up to the Referee. He doesn't even have to tell
							you. You don't have a choice. You just sold your soul.
