							These are options which are constructed within the cyberlimb for
							specific tasks. Like most cyberweapons, they are designed for
							maximum concealability, and have a 60% chance of passing a casual
							inspection if covered with Realskinn or a suitably realistic
							covering.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Cybermodem:</strong> This option allows the user to carry
							a small (and very expensive) cybermodem with him at all times. The
							modem must be jacked into a DataTerm, computer or other
							telecommunications line in order to be used Power (for up to 3
							hours) is provided by a rechargeable battery (recharges in 1
							hour), or through an external power cord. Program chips are
							changed through an access port in the limb. The cybermodem is
							directly jacked into the nervous system through its own internal
							cables, and does not require external interface plugs.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Cellular Cybermodem:</strong> This very, very expensive
							version of a cybermodem allows the Netrunner to interface directly
							with the Net without a direct telecommunications link. A "CellCyb"
							can only be used in a major city (population greater than 100,000)
							where a cell net is present. If used while in a moving vehicle,
							there is a 25% chance each turn that the connection will be broken
							and need to be re-established in the next turn.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Digital Recorder:</strong> This unit can record input from
							internal microphones, digital recording links, digital cameras, or
							all three.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Audio/Video Tape Recorder:</strong> This unit uses
							microcassettes to store input from its internal microphone video
							cam or digital recording link.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Storage Space:</strong> This is a 2x2x6 inch storage space
							with a locking cover.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>MiniCam:</strong> This is a small digital camera which
							pops up from a mount in the upper arm internal chip stores 20
							images and can be easily changed.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>MiniVid:</strong> A pop up video camera with mini
							cassettes that can store up to 4 hours of recorded images.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Hidden Holster:</strong> Leg only. A hidden storage space
							for holding one autopistol and 1 clip of extra ammo. The size of
							the leg (based on Body Type) limits the size of weapon which may
							be stored.

							<strong>LCD Screen Readout:</strong> This 2"x4" TV screen can
							display color graphic images. It is normally covered with a
							transparent screen guard images can be taken from digital
							recorders, minivids and mirocams, and cyberoptics. A cable can be
							extended from an AUX port and plugged into any standard interface
							plug to transfer images from someone else's cyberoptics or
							recorders.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Techscanner:</strong> This device can be hooked up to the
							diagnostic systems of most vehicles, appliances and personal
							electronics to determine possible problems and troubleshoot
							breakdowns. Reliability is 60%. On a successful roll, the
							difficulty of a repair task is reduced by 3 (you know what's
							wrong, and you just have to fix it).
