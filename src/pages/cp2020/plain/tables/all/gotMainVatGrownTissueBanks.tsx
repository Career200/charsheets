							This reflects recent (2017) improvements in genetic technology.
							Using tailored DNA and cell-growth vats, legs, arms, organs and
							other parts (including exotic designs like animal-human crosses)
							can be grown to order. Unlike bodybanking, vatgrown parts are
							available to match any genotype. However, the process is
							relatively new and is more expensive than simply using an arm off
							the rack (2 times the price for a similar body bank part in
							Excellent condition).
