							One advantage of cyberlimbs is the ability to mount weapons within
							their framework. Most cyberweapons of this sort are designed for
							stealth and concealability, rather than raw firepower, and have a
							60% chance of escaping detection when hidden under Realskinn or
							other suitable coverings. Weapons include:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Popup Gun:</strong> This is a standard automatic handgun
							concealed in a cyberarm. The action is mounted inside a popup
							housing which is covered when not in use. For this reason, you
							must always remember to uncover your arm when using a popup. Clips
							are inserted in the side of the action, popup guns are designed to
							use caseless ammunition only. The size of the cyberarm (based on
							Body Type) limits the size of weapon which may be mounted (similar
							to hidden holsters). Note you may elect to mount any pistol of the
							correct size listed in the Outfitting section. A light SMG equals
							a Med pistol and a medium SMG equals a Hvy Pistol for this
							purpose.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Flamethrower:</strong> This is a small, high pressure
							flame jet with a range of 1 meter, and 4 shots. Damage is 2D6 the
							1 st md., 1D6/2 for 2 mds. afterwards. Soft armor is reduced 2
							levels per attack.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Micromissile Launcher:</strong> This launcher contains
							four miniature missiles (explosive upped gyro rounds with heat
							seeking guidance and steering vents). Like the popup gun, the
							micromissile launcher is stored in the limb and pops out when
							needed, launching two missiles per turn. The missiles are
							self-guided (+2WA) and can follow a target through one direction
							change of 900 or less, giving them the ability to track around a
							corner (3 in 10 chance of losing target). Reloads cost 50eb each.
							Damage is 4D6 per missile, range 200m.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Grenade Launcher:</strong> This launcher is a modified
							support grenade launcher, stored in a popup mount. One grenade
							(you may use any standard type) is stored in the launcher; a
							reload may be dropped in after the first one is used. Note: a
							standard storage space can hold 2 grenade.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Weapon Mount and Link:</strong> This is an heavy duty hard
							point mounted either on the underside of a cyberarm, the outside
							thigh of a cyberlimb, or the top of a shoulder. You may attach
							externally mounted versions of standard weapons to this mount,
							jacking their control cables into the side of the hard point. You
							may not wear armor or clothing on the limb while the mount is in
							use. Available weapons include:

							<strong>2 Shot Capacitor Laser:</strong> This micro laser is
							designed to produce a very powerful pulse of limited duration (3D6
							for each one second shot). Range is atrocious (10 meters), and
							recharging requires plugging into a power socket for one hour.
							However, it can be a particularity effective weapon for
							assassination or silent attacks. WA=+3.
