							You can't leave anything alone - if it sits near you for more than
							five minutes, you've disassembled it and made it into something
							new. You've always got at least two screwdrivers and wrench in
							your pockets. Computer down? No problem. Hydrogen burner out in
							your Metrocar? No problem. Can't get the video to run or your
							interface plugs feedbacking? No problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							You make your living building, fixing and modifying - a crucial
							occupation in a technological world where no one person really
							knows how half the stuff works. You can make some good bucks
							fixing everyday stuff, but fir the serious money, you need to
							tackle the big jobs. Illegal weapons. Illegal or stolen cybertech.
							Corporate espionage and counterespionage gear for big boys' "black
							operations". Neat little gadgets like termite bombs and the
							hunter-killer robots for the occasional "termination".
						</p>

							If you're any good, you're making a lot of money. And that money
							goes into new gadgets, hardware and information. You'll buy almost
							any new thing - because it might have dozen side applications you
							can use. Of course, your black market work isn't just making you
							friends - it's also racking you up an impressive number of enemies
							as well; people who've run into your handiwork and resented it. So
							you'll invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed to
							the wall, call a few new markers on a Solo or two.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your cousin down the street is like you, but he's a Medtechie. In
							world where half of medicine is related to mechanics, it makes
							sense. He can do a black market surgical technique faster than you
							can fix a toaster and the Solos are always running to him to patch
							up wounds or install new illegal cybernetics. He's got a lot of
							the same problems you have, but he's hoping his new job with
							Trauma Team Inc. Tm will loosen things up You hope he's right. You
							may be needing his services sooner than think.
