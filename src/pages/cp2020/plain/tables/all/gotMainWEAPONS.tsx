							The first thing your cyberpunk is gonna want is some weapons
							(weapons can get you out of a bad situation a lot faster than a
							great stereo).
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> weapons break into seven types:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Pistols (P)</strong> are any type of single shot (or
							semiautomatic) weapon which may be accurately fired with one hand.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Submachineguns (SMG)</strong> are any type of weapon which
							may fire either automatically or semi automatically, using only
							pistol ammunition.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Shotguns (SHG)</strong> are any weapon which fires pellets
							or other small particles instead of a solid slug.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Rifles (RIF)</strong> include assault rifles, carbines,
							and fully automatic rifles. These weapons always fire rifle type
							ammunition.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Heavy Weapons (HVY)</strong> include missiles, grenades,
							heavy cannon, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Melee Weapons (MELEE)</strong> include swords, daggers,
							knives, martial arts weapons, polearms, etc.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Exotic Weapons (EX)</strong>; these are bows. lasers,
							flechette pistols, airguns and microwave weapons - the real
							"sci-fi" weapons of the <em>Cyberpunk</em> universe.
