							While a cyborg is usually defined as anyone who has mechanical
							technology grafted into his body, the line is actually pretty
							nebulous (is your girlfriend a cyborg because she wears contact
							lenses? Is your grandmother a cyborg because she has a hearing aid
							and an artificial hip joint?). In this hazy zone of cybertech is
							fashionware - little hi-tech gadgets common to the{' '}
							<em>Cyberpunk</em> future.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Biomonitor:</strong> This is a favorite of Solos, gadget
							freaks, and harried Corporates worried about their blood pressure.
							Mounted just below the skin of the forearm, the Biomonitor gives a
							constant readout of pulse, respiration, brainwaves, blood sugar,
							temperature, and cholesterol levels. The display is a pattern of
							word shaped LEDs, each running a color sequence from red
							(critical) to green (excellent). As conditions change, the colors
							change. The user merely shoots back his cuff, looks for the little
							glowing word display he wants, and checks the color. In game
							terms, this adds +2 to any Resist Torture/Drugs check.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Skinwatch:</strong> The predecessor of the Biomonitor, the
							Skinwatch is implanted just below the epidermis, and uses tiny
							LEDs to project glowing numerals through the skin. Skinwatches can
							be mounted anywhere, although the hand, wrist and fingers are the
							most common. Advanced versions can be reset by pressing the
							display gently until the right number combinations come up; really
							advanced versions have alarms that beep quietly. Use your
							imagination.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Light Tattoos:</strong> These are light emitting chemical
							patches inserted under the first couple layers of skin. They store
							light and emit it in colors or patterns.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Shift-tacts:</strong> These are colored contact lenses,
							designed to mimic certain aspects of more expensive cyberoptics.
							Mirrored contacts in all tints, temperature or emotion sensitive
							contacts that change color on demand, logo or patterned contacts.
							These are available in most fashionable bodyware shops. Check it
							out.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>ChemShins:</strong> These are special dyes and chemicals
							which are impregnated or rubbed into the skin. Some change the
							skin color to a new shade as desired. Others are temperature
							sensitive, and shift colors in vibrant patterns when warmed or
							cooled. Very expensive chemskins are sensitive to hormonal
							changes; you could buy a chemskin that would make yellow and black
							tiger stripes appear on your skin when you became angry or
							excited.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Synthskins:</strong> A more sophisticated version of light
							tattoo technology, a synthskin is a layer of color-shifting
							plastic bonded to the character's outer skin. A synthskin can be
							adjusted to display colors, patterns, light-flares or other
							special effects, using tuning chips (cost 100eb) which are plugged
							into a socket in the skin (usually under the hairline).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Techhair:</strong> The shafts of this artificial hair are
							impregnated with various types of reactive chemicals. Some types
							are temperature sensitive and change color or stand up depending
							on the weather. Others contain the same pigments used in light
							tattoos, storing and emitting colored light in patterns. Still
							others can change color as desired by using special chemical
							shampoos. Techhair can be implanted in mohawks, hair weaves, full
							hairpieces, manes, ruffs, whiskers and other less obvious (but
							interesting) places.
