							We can do some pretty amazing things these days. We can grow skin,
							blood, organs, limbs and muscle tissue in collagen-saccharide
							tissue tanks. Other parts, like toes, fingers, eyes and internal
							organs can also be purchased from the local Body Bank and grafted
							on with advanced micro-surgery. What we can't do is regrow souls.
							Once you're dead, you're dead.
						</p>
						<p>
							Let's amend that: once you're DEAD 10, you're dead. Because
							twenty-first century medicine is so good at reviving the
							clinically dead, Trauma Team Inc. (the world's largest paramedical
							service, with offices worldwide), has established ten levels of
							death, each succeeding level a measure of how difficult it will be
							to revive the patient. This measuring system is called Death
							State. For every minute (six turns) that you are clinically dead,
							your death state increases by two levels.
							<em>
								Example: 1 am killed at 9:00. Three minutes pass before the
								Trauma Team AV-4 arrives. 1 am now at Death State 6.
							</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is of critical importance to the dead Cyberpunk character.
							When the Trauma Team arrives, a roll must be made to determine if
							the patient can be revived. This roll, on 1D10, must be higher
							than the current Death State number, or the patient is a candidate
							for the Body Bank. On a successful roll, the patient is stabilized
							at his last Wound State and the process of healing can begin.
