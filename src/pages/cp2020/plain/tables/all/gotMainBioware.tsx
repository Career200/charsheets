							Bioware is anything which is primarily low impact technology that
							is designed along biological rather than me chanical lines.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most bioware enhancements involve the use of
							<em>nonotechnology</em> tiny machines the size of microbes, which
							can perform surgical tasks on the cellular level. These "nanoids"
							are injected into the area to be affected, along with a supply of
							the raw materials needed to perform their jobs (for example, long
							string polymers which can be woven by the nanoids into a type of
							Subdermal armor called skinweave). Powered by body heat and
							nutnent chemicals, these tiny machines quietly go about their
							business, strengthening muscles and altering body chemistry.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Grafted Muscle:</strong> This is vat-grown muscle grafted
							onto your own, with healing. With this modification, you may
							increase your Body Type stat up to 2 points, paying 1000 eb per
							point. It can be combined with M<em>uscle/Bone Lace</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Muscle &amp; Bone Lace:</strong> Also known as
							<em>viral transformation</em>, this enhancement involves two types
							of nanoids. The first type threads synthetic muscle through the
							natural muscle fibers anchoring and strengthening them. The second
							type wraps the bones in a tight weave of metal and plastic
							threads, making them stronger and thicker. The result is an
							increase of +2 to the character's Body Type stat. This increase is
							both in strength and the ability to absorb physical damage. This
							enhancement is virtually indetectable and takes about two weeks
							(Body Type increases by 1 each week).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Skin Weave:</strong> This enhancement uses nanoids to
							weave the top three layers of skin with a dense polymer thread.
							The result is a bare skin SP of 12 equivalent to light body armor.
							The process is relatively discreet (a DIFFICULT Awareness check to
							notice) and takes about two weeks (SP increases by 6 each week).
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Enhanced Antibodies:</strong> These are tailored
							antibodies capable of attacking the most powerful viruses in game
							play they double the rate of healing.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Toxin Binders:</strong> These are nanoids designed to bond
							with body toxins and poisons. This enhancement adds +4 to all
							poison saves.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Nanosurgeons:</strong> These are microscopic machines
							adapted to surgical repair. Some seal off damaged blood vessels,
							while others repair damaged tissue cartilage and bone with polymer
							microstiches. This enhancement doubles normal healing time.
