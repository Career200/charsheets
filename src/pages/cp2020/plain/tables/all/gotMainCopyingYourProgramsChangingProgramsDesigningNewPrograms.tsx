							A smart idea. You can copy almost any program in your arsenal. All
							you need is the <em>Backup</em> utility, a data chip, and a
							chipreader to put it in. A single chip holds 1 MU, but{' '}
							<em>Backup</em> is designed to break a larger file up over two or
							more chips.
						</p>
						<p>
							Chips cost 10.00. To copy the contents of the average deck will
							cost between 100 to 300 eb. Cheap at twice the price.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Note:</strong> Anti-IC and Anti-Personnel pro-grams cannot
							be
							<em>Backup</em>-copied; they have special copy-protection routines
							that erase the chip in the copy process. This makes sure you come
							back to your friendly local Fixer for a new copy of{' '}
							<em>Hellhound</em> when yours crashes. You can make a copy using
							your Programming Skill against a Task Difficulty of 28. But think
							what happens if you screw up...

							Chips are inserted into your deck before the start of the run.
							Once you're in the face, you're committed. However, if you're
							will-ing to dump out of the Net and abort the run, you can change
							chips (1 turn). You'll have to jack back in and retrace your
							steps, but this time when you meet that <em>Brainwipe</em>, you'll
							be ready.
