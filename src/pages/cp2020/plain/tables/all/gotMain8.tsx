								Forget everything you ever thought about cyborgs. Everything.
							</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the 2000's. Today's cyborg is stylish. His cybernetics are
							designed for a streamlined, highmover lifestyle. Whether equipped
							with implanted data chips in his nervous system to enhance his
							tennis game, or bio-engineered miniweapons for his personal
							protection, the cyborg of the 2000's is the cutting edge of high
							tech living.
						</p>
						<p>
							But he isn't necessarily a walking tank either. Cybertech can be
							smoother than that - less obvious. You have to integrate your
							newtech gadgets into a slick, seamless whole. You're either
							predator or prey, and the faster you learn to blur the line
							between the two categories, the longer you'll survive.
						</p>
						<p>And that's the point. Survival.</p>
