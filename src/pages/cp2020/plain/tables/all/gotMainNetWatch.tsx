							NetWatch is a policing organization designed to patrol the Net
							looking for illegal activity. Governments, individual corporations
							and other large groups contribute money, equipment and their best
							Netrunners to the NetWatch organization. The NetCops are equipped
							with very powerful software and move freely through the Net,
							patrolling a specific "beat" that may cover a city, Region or even
							a continent.
						</p>
						<p>
							NetCops (Wolves, Weasels, The Icemen) are equipped with very
							powerful tracking programs, as well as "arrest" programs that can
							freeze a cyberdeck in a "loop" and hold the Netrunner frozen,
							unable to jack out until released. While arrest and imprisonment
							are the goal of the NetCops, they have been known to use black
							programs to kill or maim their opposition.
