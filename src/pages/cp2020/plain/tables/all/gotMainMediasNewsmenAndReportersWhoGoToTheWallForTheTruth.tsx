							They're bending truth out there. And you're going to stop them.
							Someone has to do it. The Corporations rule the world. They dump
							toxics, destabilize economies and commit murder with equal
							impunity. The Government won't stop them - they own the
							Government. The only thing between the Corporations and world
							domination is the Media. And that's you.
						</p>
						<p>
							You've got a videocam and press pass - and you're not afraid to
							use them. You're a national figure, seen nightly on a million TV
							sets worldwide. You've got fans, contacts and your own Corporation
							backing you. They can't make you disappear. When you dig down for
							the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate lapdogs try
							to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can put the
							details of their crimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens.
							Then the Government has to act.
						</p>
						<p>
							A week ago, you followed a hot lead and discovered a medical
							corporation dumping illegal drugs on the Street. This week, you're
							uncovered a secret Corporate war in South America - a war with
							jets, bombs, and cybertroops that's killed almost seven thousand
							innocent people. Each new story you get to the air is one more
							blow for freedom and justice. Not mention ratings.
						</p>
						<p>
							It isn't easy. They've tried to pressure your Mediacorp dozen of
							times. You've had stories suppressed - once, Corporate pressure
							forced them to cancel your news show. Each time, you went to the
							top, backed by your news director and crew, and fought to get the
							story out. Three of four times, they tried to kill you - that's
							why your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of the
							top Runners in the business digging through the Net to back your
							stories. You have to be good, or else.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. He's found a line on
							twenty tons of illegal weapons being shifted to a port in Bolivia
							- possibly nuclear. You grab your gear and flag your backup.
							You're going to break those bastards.
						</p>
						<p>This time, for sure.</p>
