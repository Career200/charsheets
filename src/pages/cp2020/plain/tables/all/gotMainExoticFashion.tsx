							Bodysculpt jobs that emphasize the alien or inhuman are known as
							<strong>Exotics</strong>. Vat-grown tails, furred skins, hooves,
							animal-like faces and ears, cats eyes and other semi human
							features are the highlights of this style. Exotic fashion is
							incredibly expensive, time consuming and usually a hobby among
							only the very rich and very bored. Prices are based on the
							individual enhancements.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Facial Sculpts</strong> combine vat-grown parts such as
							muzzles, whiskers, animal-like ears, manes and cat eyes with the
							patient's normal features. There are entire booster-gangs based
							around various animal motifs of this type. Cost: 5,000eb.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Tails</strong> are grown in vats, using gene bank tissue.
							They can be furred, tinted, scaled or bare skin. The tail is
							grafted to the base of the spine and linked to the nervous system
							by nanotech nerve threaders. Tails are relatively weak; they can
							pick up about a half pound. Cost: 3,000eb.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Hooves, claws</strong> and <strong>paws</strong> can be
							grafted to replace normal feet and hands. They are not as
							dexterous as normal digits (-2 to REF), but are occasionally
							included as part of a Exotic bodysculpt. Cost: 8,000 eb.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Skin alteration</strong> uses transform DNA to change the
							structure of the patient's skin. Using tailored DNA, the skin can
							be induced to grow patterned fur, light scales, or exotic skin
							colors. The big drawback is a 1 in 10 chance that the graft will
							mutate and develop into skin cancer. You get to pick the number.
							Cost: 10,000eb.
