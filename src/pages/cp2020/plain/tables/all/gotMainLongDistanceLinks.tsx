							Long Distance Links, (LDLs) allow instantaneous transfer between
							cities. The world wide Internet Communications Corporation
							maintains most of the available Long Distance Links as part of its
							long distance services, but many large corps have private Long
							Distance Links that go only between corporate offices.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using a Long Distance Link requires a password (normally the
							Netrunner's Net Access code, which is used for billing purposes).
							However, with the right programs, one can convince a Internet that
							<em>this</em> call is a local one, of that the call was never
							actually made.
