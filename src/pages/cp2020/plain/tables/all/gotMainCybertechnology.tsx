							Cybertechnology can be purchased almost anywhere. Some of the
							medical procedures are simple, walk-in types of surgery, with
							minor installations taking place in shopping mall clinics (
							<em>Bodyshoppe</em>, <em>Fashion/Fusion</em>, and
							<em>Parts N'Programms</em> are three popular chain stores) or drop
							in medical centers (Docs R Us ). These installations are much like
							getting your ears pierced, circa 1980. You can even have upgrades
							and improvements plugged into the old hardware for the cost of the
							new parts, allowing you to start small (called stripped or
							economy) and add as you go.
						</p>
						<p>
							What can't be bought openly are the types of cyberware known as
							Black-market Cybertech. These items can only be purchased through
							criminal contacts on the Street, and installed by high priced,
							underground medtechs known as Ripperdocs. Black-market cybertech
							is often dangerous, badly installed, and always expensive. But
							hey, we're all big kids here, and besides, you know what to do to
							a Ripperdoc who messes around with you, right?
