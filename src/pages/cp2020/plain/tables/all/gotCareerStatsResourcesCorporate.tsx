							This represents the Corporate's ability to command corporation
							resources. It is used as a persuasion skill, based on the scale of
							resources requested. This could include bodyguards, weapons,
							vehicles, buildings, money, etc. Obviously, the more powerful the
							Corporate, the more he can call upon at any one time. Your level
							of
							<em>Resources</em> determines exactly how much you can request
							from the Corporation without overreaching yourself. A
							<em>Resource</em> ability +2 might get you access to a Company
							car. An ability of +6 might allow you to use the Corporate
							Security Division. A <em>Resources</em> of +9 would allow you
							access to almost all levels of the Corporation, as well as the
							ability to requisition almost any Company resource. Your{' '}
							<em>Resource</em> ability is applied to your INT stat.
