							Programs are the work horses of Netrunning; they do the fighting,
							protecting, decrypting and sneaking for the 'Runner. If a
							Netrunner is a cybernetic magician, then programs are his spells,
							there at his mental fingertips.
						</p>
						<p>
							Programs are rated by Strength, Class, Memory Units used, Cost and
							ICON:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Strength</strong> is how powerful the program is, relative
							to other programs. In combat, the Strength of a program is usually
							added to the Netrunner's attack roll (much like Weapon Accuracy in
							a combat situation). The higher the Strength, the better chance
							the program will be able to do it's job.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Class</strong> is the type of program; its function
							intrusion programs sneak in. Detection programs detect, Anti-IC
							programs attack other programs, and Anti-personnel programs attack
							Netrunners. And so on.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Memory Units</strong> represent the size of the program.
							All programs are measured in Memory Units, or MU. Each memory of a
							cyberdeck or system can hold 10 Memory Units. This means space is
							at a premium for Netrunners, you can only stack up so much in one
							run.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Cost</strong> is the price of the program on the open or
							black market. Nothing in the future is free. Not even the air,
							chombatta.
						</p>
						<p>
							The <strong>ICON</strong> is what the program usually looks like
							in the Net. But don't count on it, you can alter your program's
							ICONs to suit your own tastes and style. Just goes to show; don't
							trust anything.
						</p>
						<p>
							Enough talk-talk. Read the programs and spend your euro. You got a
							run to make.
