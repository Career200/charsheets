							The drugs of the future are far more lethal than their 20th
							century counterparts. Many are experimental chemicals dumped on
							the Street by unscrupulous Corporations looking for guinea pigs.
							Some are home-brewed horrors designed in basement labs. Still
							others are military-designed combat drugs designed to create
							armies of zombie killing machines. All of them are bad news.
						</p>
						<p>
							Most of the drugs in Cyberpunk are addictive - the people who
							designed them were looking for a way to create a captive market of
							addicts. Only the very wealthy can afford to have non-toxic
							"designer drugs" created for their own physiologies; most of the
							scum on the Street (the rest of you) are left sucking up the dregs
							of the chemical sewer.
						</p>
						<p>Common street drugs include:</p>
						<p>
							<strong>SynthCoke</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Stimulant Strength: +1
							<br />
							Difficulty: 20
							<br />
							Cost: 1000
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 minutes
							<br />
							The second generation, synthetic replacement for cocaine. Like the
							original, its side effects are nasty: paranoia, psychological
							addiction.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Stim</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Stimulant
							<br />
							Strength: +3
							<br />
							Difficulty: 10 Cost: 500
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 minutes
							<br />
							Stim increases endurance, allowing the user to stay alert for
							longer periods. Side effects include mental delusions.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Syncomp 15</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Antidote Strength: +3
							<br />
							Difficulty: 13 Cost: 650
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 turns
							<br />
							Syncomp is a broad spectrum poison antidote, used to treat nerve
							and biotoxins. REF is reduced at the rate of 1 point per dose.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Speedheal</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Healing Drug
							<br />
							Strength: +2
							<br />
							Dificulty: 33
							<br />
							Cost: 1650
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 hours
							<br />
							Speedheal (described on pg. 107), is designed to enhance the
							natural healing processes. Side effects are reduced REF by 1D6/3
							for a period of 1 week after use.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Boost</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: INT Booster
							<br />
							Strength: +4
							<br />
							Difficulty: 12 Cost: 600
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 hours
							<br />
							Boost increases INT by +1 for a 2-7 hour period. A Boost addict
							has gained full tolerance - his INT is no longer increased, and he
							must have more Boost within twelve hours or be reduced to
							screaming fits and hallucinations.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Blue Glass</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Hallucinogenic
							<br />
							Strength: +1
							<br />
							Difficulty: 18
							<br />
							Cost: 900
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 minutes
							<br />
							Blue Glass was originally developed as a biological weapon. Under
							stress, you will have a 3 in 10 chance of "flashing out" - reduced
							to staring blankly at the pretty colors in your mind (reduce INT
							by 1 per dose). Roll 1D10 and hope.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Smash</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Euphoric Strength: +1
							<br />
							Difficulty: 2<br />
							Cost: 100 per 6 pk
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 minutes
							<br />
							Smash is 2020's answer to aIcohol - it's yellow, foamy, and comes
							in cans. It makes you loose, happy and ready to party. The
							downside is that when it wears off, its psychological addiction
							component makes you suicidal. If you fail your addiction Save, you
							sink into total catatonia; a1 feebly mumbling ball of pain - a
							ripe target for some Booster looking for spare change.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>'Dorph</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Pain Negation
							<br />
							Strength: +2
							<br />
							Difficulty: 5<br />
							Cost: 250
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 turns
							<br />
							Designed as a combat drug and painkiller, endorphins reduce pain
							and stress effects. 'Dorph allows you to reduce the effects of
							stun or shock. Dorph also has a nasty cost in nervous system
							damage. Each time you use 'dorph, roll an additional 1D10. On a 1,
							you have lost 1 point of REF - permanently.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Black Lace</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Type: Pain Negation
							<br />
							Strength: +3
							<br />
							Difficulty: 13
							<br />
							Cost: 650
							<br />
							Duration: 1D6+1 hours
							<br />A high powered version of 'Dorph which imparts euphoria,
							adrenal rush, and invulnerability to pain. Your CL is raised by 2,
							and you are resistant to stun or shock effects. Lace is deadly.
							Lace users become fearless, cold-blooded killing machines -
							exactly what its military designers were looking for. If you fail
							your addiction save (1D10 roll higher than Body Type) roll an
							additional 1D6 and subtract the result from your EMP stat. Treat
							the result as if suffering from cyberpsychosis. If you go over the
							line, too bad. Roll up another character.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Remember:</strong> Drugs are dangerous. Mess with them and
							you'll probably kill your character. Or at least mess him up
							beyond repair. The choice is yours.
						</p>
						<p>Just like real life.</p>
